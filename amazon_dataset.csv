series cant use other bluetooth speakers other manufacturers even other models sony speakers do being said language app very vague makes sound like can grab old bluetooth speaker create wireless speaker network curious see if actually case grabbed pair bluetooth speakers other manufacturers attempted pair sadly expected neither one would pair second apps control customizable led light ring isnt quite led believe given packaging documentation hope use speaker home theater system paired home theater pc rather than phone tablet given speakers ability link up other speakers id had thoughts about maybe using eventually implement wireless surround sound andor whole home speaker system pc setup has nice blue led lighting effect thought would cool get led ring speaker match blue rest setup has thats discovered second shortcoming app cant select single color led ring glow app only gives list preset color schemes can choose cycle through cant select just single color tell speaker hold continuously special psa lighting if youre epileptic dont attempt use speaker until adjust color settings default speaker came rave mode has white flashing strobes along left right edges no mention strobe effect materials read prior getting speaker little disturbing enabled default third voice control button within app doesnt appear actually do anything pressing prompts say keyword tried saying sony speaker hey play queens bohemian rhapsody had no luck getting app speaker react pressing help button within app didnt lead anything offering support saying google did pull up screen icons google music youtube couldnt get app do anything beyond point using voice controls unfortunately shortcomings arent limited just app speaker also has button top bass boost upon first using speaker very impressed sound clear loud lot punch curious see would sound like even more bass pressed bass button top sound immediately went flat tinny apparently bass button already enabled default given way set up bass button less boost button more make music sound anemic bad button perception would much improved had not opted enabled default using speaker phone call yielded mixed results audio came over both loud crystal clear end being said person other line said voice distant full distortion suffice say speakers microphone isnt very good couple warnings if youre going try use speaker pc first wont able control speakers settings pc youre going use phone app control things like power management led lighting secondly youre going want go into power management options within app turn off autooff power saving feature feature enabled default speaker doesnt automatically wake after powering down if dont turn off autooff then forced press power button speaker turn back after powers down amazing thing despite shortcomings ive listed still really like speaker led lighting fun sound terrific lots volume bass aesthetic nice clean speaker perfect no speaker really good yes despite shortcomings im still seriously considering buying another one use home theater setup would recommend product,4,1

am using gpx555 small commercial kitchen foregone conclusion acoustics horrendous moreover oven hoods stoves hot cold tables whooshing rattling machines spinning making egregious screeching noises fans blowing buzzers doorbells phones going off people shouting cursing each other etcthe gpx555 has pretty good overall sound reproduction quality plenty volume even less than ideal setting volume control stepless increments single values 050 course somebody had mash way up within seconds thing being plugged kind pantera slipknot ratm crap sounded very loud very good no discernible clipping distortion lasted only seconds much too loud good thing we settled 35 rest night loud possible while still being able communicate using raised voices everyone has do anyway understood irrespective superficial tertiary electronically engendered harmonic dissonancei allocated budget 400usd only other unit considered samsung mx js5000 around 300usd because had so reviews however again again heard people complaining about lack bass so decided go gpx555 because had dedicated 10 inch subwooferthe only space available top one coolers about 8 feet above ground know past experience subwoofer placement can significant effect amount bass output floor space premium even if corner floor available proprietary cords connect head unit three speakers preclude use normal monster cable extensionperhaps because subwoofer high above ground not near corner am really disapointed low frequency bass response granted didnt very high expectations one shelf stereo priced circa 380usd hopeful read naive dedicated 10 inch subwoofer unit touted differentiated peers would deliver facsimile accurate bass responseunfortunately least location application low end just isnt contrariwise weak muddy midrange high range bass sure know music like well enough really miss low thunderous bass hits should drop tried out 2pac only god can judge now wonda call u bitchsic stevie ray vaughan riviera paradise little wing chitlins con carne bob marley time tell ratatat songs album classicsall these songs nice low frequency bass hits chest rattles walls windows drops system capable subwoofer did not hear lowest bass while using gpx555 way comparison another system owned comprised affordable recertified harman kardon separates ie 2 channel receiver 150usd two bookshelf speakers 150usd 12 inch powered subwoofer 150usd while certainly not spectacular could least hear lowest low bass am opinion really cant get decent subwoofer under 400 500usd so had no delusions about recertified stuff price range whilst didnt play lowest notes very loud were definitely audiblewith gpx555 just didnt hear notes entire frequency ranges low end do not know exact cutoff low end can no longer reproduce notes if ever used winamp played around 10 band equalizer lowest slider 70hz highest 16khz then may grasp am speculating nothing below say 250hz 180hz somewhere around being reproducedfor frame reference listen most music pair sennheiser hd650 headphones lossless flac shn wav source output through winamp always finetune winamps 10 band eq into sort v shape lowest highest sliders almost max then each slider between those two progressively lower such slider 1khz very middle almost way down center v shapeand can tell low notes these songs mentioned those below 180hz 2nd lowest slider eq hit hard boomy sound great headphones such anticipated hearing those notes 10inch subwoofer gpx555 just werent should point out using gpx555 kitchen addition sub optimal placement subwoofer am also not using lossless audio source nor am playing through winamp 10 band eqeverybody just puts youtube videos believe manner lossy flash html5 player whatever has no equalizer am aware course left right audio composite patch cord running computer gpx 555 not gold plated low guage nitrogen purged etc etc ad nauseam ad infinitum ergo these shortcomings indubitably degrading sound qualitywhat done though make sure sonys bass boost unit call bass bazuka inane crap turned does fact make very noticeable difference off absolutely no low end decentish amount muddy midrange high range bassthis unit also has dedicated control adjust level subwoofer itself 010db high go also around 10 built eq presets available tried effort get bass hit know feeling get chest bass drops still am not hearing lowest notesit also has custom eq setting consists only three bands not labeled numerical hz value only low mid high manually set close possible v shape use winamp low high max mids near minimum configuration used test songs mentionedas far build quality goes sony gpx555 very plasticky extremely lightweight size now maybe headunit speaker technology has changed since time picked up hk stuff surprised light speakers headunit were considering size cost maybe weight magnet no longer necessary sufficient variable solve equation qualityall controls thing ridiculously oversized chintzy not particularly tactile sturdy feeling guess could say soft touch type buttons lot give has decent size display graphics look like something out alpine car audio headunit 1995 volume nob size grapefruit unknown reason much too bigthe face headunit cone each speaker subwoofer led lighting color pattern can changed disabled entirely honestly would prefer if sony had reallocated costs accrued gimmicky nonessential lightshow into higher quality audio components headunit speakers effort provide better audio quality same costone selling points unit bluetooth near field communication capable somebody figured out get phone talk pretty easily so now can control basically settings choose music cost data plan also comes small remote seemingly bereft mute button replete two aaa batteriesas stated previously speaker wires too short ie 6ft maybe idk b no speaker posts c use proprietary connector looks more like ethernet jack than elsesomething else noticed again maybe just way speakers evolved actual woofer cones speakers subwoofer do not move music playing cones every other set speakers owned move out time notes distance traveled increases direct proportion volume levelall would say if

really liked these wanted keep because make one heck first impression ultimately had return removing lid box greets unmistakable smell brand new genuine leather thick headband ear cups baby soft premium leather way metal frame connects strong gives confidence theyre not going accidentally bend break anything almost intentional force against heres first comparison peers most every other set even over 300 almost completely plastic solid metal leather through through heavier than competitors thats already striking difference makes good argument higher price tag obviously higher quality product better materials also like ear cups removable magnetically attached should unrepairable break tear just buy new set pop underneath left cup cord attaches also great idea port tends get damaged cord pulled water seeps can tell lot thought put towards design picture doesnt do these justice impress top bottom one thing dont look like something want sweat over wear rainy days so something else gyms sweltering heat storm season outdoors theyre also softer than look ear pads filled memory foam so theyre very soft touch headband also nicely padded also like added thickness top did feel good first put felt discomfort during hours wearing clamping pressure started make upper jaw under ear ache seal very well isolate most outside noise theyre easily best noise isolating headphones ive ever put fold both sides fit easier small bag case making more portable ear cups dont swivel thoughill honest about sound say came away disappointed dont sound bad means theyre warmer mid range like sacrifices treble im used cycled through variety different types music comparing directly against audio technica m50xs didnt blow away kind expecting do given price point reputation then realized wasnt realistic expectation because m50xs actually very good headphones nothing going make sound like garbage thought p7s would outperform so well id just ditch completely didnt happen fact im now convinced probably not wise expect competent set headphones rendered obsolete more expensive set like these if good set already thats least over 100 200 up well established companies like sennheiser vmoda beyerdynamic bose audio technica sony etc intentionally omitting over priced overrated beats p7s wont completely redefine good sound least didnt once got over focused do well much do differently than already m50xs just notch above neutral bass treble no mids something like about these different flavor altogether mids lows much more pronounced pushing vocals forefront beck practically singing right front face played music stringed instruments classical jazz genres also received big boost extra attention cellos harps stand up basses were much fuller than other set ever told bass kicked electronic music daft punk deadmau5 up notches over ats well never got overbearing obnoxious really like deeper bass thicker overall sound bass heavy music im not bass head so dont want bass drowning out instruments vocals either sounds like getting close threshold going over edge never getting like lot rock music too something ats can do very well most bands actually sounded better than p7s probably due treble coming down couple notches prefer v shaped sound favoring treble bass fact usually treble dialed way up eqs so missed high sizzle cymbals snap snare drums also couldnt distinguish instruments well harder tunes heavier distortion guitars particularly heavy song high hat cymbal almost completely drowned out took m50xs remember much should hearing extra emphasis mids bass made sound fuller muddied separation p7s made most everything sound better outperformed m50xs just not rock category big one came up short according tastes headphones originally priced 400 shouldnt such glaring weakness should do everything really well dont main reason had let gooutside music p7s also worked well tv shows movies vocals came through clearly soundtracks effects delivered more home theater like experience extra oomph really delivered action scenes dialog more distinguishable m50xs held own while doing direct comparison thoughthere 2 cords provided one attached apple devices included controls worked flawlessly ipad cord even feels better comparison others ive felt drawback included case while nice receive one same fine leather found headphones im not fan soft cases especially not expensive electronics itll do fine around house light travel use if youre going put these suitcase travel far frequently id reservations these well worth little extra money protect falls drops getting sat being crushed other bags included soft case also looks more like one wifes makeup bags bit turn off thats very minor gripe thoughin conclusion these premium luxury headphones look like feel like smell like come short sounding like matters most if youve already invested decent set headphones wont completely redefine portable listening theyll provide quality product thats physically head shoulders above everything else ive seen store shelvesi still do recommend these people want premium build appreciate warmer sounds heavy vocals stringed instruments almost everything else theyre still very good hard rock achilles heel though im just like hearing separation amongst distortion now greater appreciation m50xs though going head head against high end headphone like p7 coming out top pretty remarkable even though tough decision main reason couldnt keep just couldnt justify paying 300 set headphones didnt completely outperform m50xs actually lacking treble like hurt extra clamping force sure nice looking,4,1

headphones best heard very comfortable quality soft leather ear cups great highs good bass make these quality headphones joy,5,1
man do these make one heck first impression removing lid box greets unmistakable smell brand new genuine leather thick headband ear cups baby soft premium leather way metal frame connects strong gives confidence theyre not going accidentally bend break anything almost intentional force against heres first comparison peers most every other set even over 300 almost completely plastic solid metal leather through through thats already striking difference makes good argument higher price tag obviously higher quality product better materials also like ear cups removable magnetically attached should unrepairable break tear just buy new set pop underneath left cup cord attaches also great idea port tends get damaged cord pulled water seeps can tell lot thought put towards design picture doesnt do these justice impress top bottom one thing dont look like something want sweat over wear rainy days so something else gyms sweltering heat storm season outdoors theyre also much more comfortable than look ear pads filled memory foam so theyre very soft touch headband also nicely padded also like added thickness top while did feel little clampy first put never felt real discomfort during hours wearing also seal very well isolate most outside noise theyre easily best noise isolating headphones ive ever put fold both sides fit easier small bag case making more portable ear cups dont swivel thoughill honest about sound say little disappointed first cycled through variety different types music comparing directly against audio technica m50xs didnt blow away kind expecting do given price point reputation then realized wasnt realistic expectation because m50xs actually very good headphones nothing going make sound like garbage thought p7s would outperform so well id just ditch completely well didnt happen fact im now convinced probably not wise expect competent set headphones rendered obsolete more expensive set like these if good set already thats least over 100 200 up well established companies like sennheiser vmoda beyerdynamic bose audio technica etc intentionally omitting over priced overrated beats p7s wont completely redefine good sound least didnt once got over focused do well much do differently than already m50xs just slight notch above neutral bass treble no mids something like about these different flavor altogether mids lows much more pronounced pushing vocals forefront beck practically singing right front face played music stringed instruments classical jazz genres also received big boost extra attention cellos harps stand up basses were much fuller than other set ever told bass kicked electronic music daft punk deadmau5 up notches over ats well never got overbearing obnoxious really like deeper bass thicker overall sound bass heavy music im not bass head so dont want bass drowning out instruments vocals either sounds like right threshold going over edge never getting like lot rock music too something ats can do very well bands actually sounded better than p7s probably due treble coming down couple notches prefer v shaped sound favoring treble bass fact usually treble dialed way up eqs so missed high sizzle cymbals snap snare drums also couldnt distinguish instruments well harder tunes heavier distortion guitars push mids made sound fuller muddied separation little more most everything p7s did everything better outperformed m50xs just came up little short times according tastesoutside music p7s also worked great tv shows movies vocals came through clearly soundtracks effects delivered more home theater like experience extra oomph really delivered action scenes dialog more distinguishablethere 2 cords provided one attached apple devices included controls worked flawlessly ipad ipod cord even feels better comparison others ive felt one drawback included case while nice receive one same fine leather found headphones im not fan soft cases especially not expensive electronics itll do fine around house light travel use if youre going put these suitcase travel far frequently id reservations im ordering hard case just such uses these well worth little extra money protect falls drops getting sat being crushed other bags included soft case also looks more like one wifes makeup bags bit turn off thats very minor gripe thoughin conclusion these premium luxury headphones look like feel like smell like sound like if use already invested decent set headphones wont completely redefine portable listening theyll provide quality product thats head shoulders above everything else ive seen store shelves probably wouldve had buyers remorse had paid original 400 asking price these 280 cyber monday would take lot convince theres better made sounding headphone than bw p7 one those rare times getting pay turns out good thing highly recommended music listeners those appreciate little luxury every now thennote after cyber monday p7s went up 350 looks like new standard asking price still seems like pretty good deal keeps top heap price range,5,1

significantly negative reviews probably genuine based users actual experiences however also seems more than based solely misunderstanding misuse product if can help clear up provide another perspective hope can do sofirst logitechs legacy product naming conventions compared current harmony line up early 2016 website can get confusing names one ultimate home touch can become frustrating trying figure out best remote control needs case point purchased ultimate one ir remote knowing full well id eventually need add hub provide bluetooth control wii u ps3 ended up ordering hub separately only find later could ordered logitech 915000237 harmony ultimate home touch screen remote 15 home entertainment automation devices black saved money again note according logitechs current website package no longer offered if like remote think youll need use hub id recommend package best can tell same remote addition hub less then price two were buy individually like did oh wellsecond harmony compatibility site pretty excellent just tell manufacturer model number equipment tell pretty much everything need know can controlled cant harmony products youll need comprehensive database compatible devices say leastthird much has said myharmony desktop software overall thought fine relatively easy use can tell work progress not quite slick polished interface remote itself however while may end up going couple circles software does always seem realize changes youve made ultimately guide need seems smart enough realize users may do things different order based specific hardware catches up so speak ensure remote hub if one kept sync dont think need expert use could see lower end technosavvy scale might not understand difficulty overall feeling though if youre considering line products first place youll fine softwaresidebar bit harmony home hub logitech 915000238 harmony home hub smartphone control 8 home entertainment automation devices ultimate one remote infrared only so if devices require control via bluetooth like ps3 wii u youll need hub if want control remote can apparently also use smartphone app once hub havent tried dont really intention either still nice know add hub profile myharmony desktop software couple ways do either upgrading remote hub setting up new harmony device both methods get again software realize installing hub new device upgrading remote same thing route through required steps regardless do if buy both set up remote first then add hub once set up remote example activity named play ps3 signal hub provide bluetooth signal power ps3 works greatfourth ergonomics usability lot talk about ergos usability remote say honestly find negative reviews quite surprising use one best pieces consumer tech ive ever purchased works exactly promised way way more pleasure use than number reviews make out big part operation behavior screen not like smartphones screen prone accidental brushes taps takes appropriately deliberate touch activate anything each intentional press confirmed nice little haptic feedback buzz vibration let know wanted selectedalso rarely mentioned beyond screen defaults lock screen meaning lights up wont register touch press until swipe unlock use lets say youre watching tv remote just sitting asleep get up do something want pause even record dvr using hardware buttons can absolutely use those keys without inadvertently touching something screen screen remain locked out apparently setting can turn lock screen feature off im not sure would want completely removes issue interference hand again not like errant brush hand cause unwanted key selection anywayon top screen features slick gestures screen slides up bottom allows pause play volume up down fast forward rewind simply sweeping finger tapping screen without ever having look down again too works exceptionally well gestures screen persist too meaning if slide up activate then set remote down goes back sleep soon pick up again gestures screen still find myself leaving screen open most time truly simple intuitive usea lot has made unergonomic remote just dont get use works extremely well really do not think logitech committed massive deign errors rather seems very well thought out super cleverthe activities set up via desktop application just plain work fun watch everything turn set themselves correct inputs even if reason wont remote guide through fix read about didnt really understand until saw action myself first time went use play ps3 activity ps3 did not power up remote asked if everything came told no asked device didnt selected ps3 popped up little tutorial pair harmony hub ps3 took maybe two minutes pair two then worked perfectly very helpful simplenavigating screens easy only handful dedicated home favorites settings keys around screen get back want immediately spend ten minutes using promise youll down pat every activity mode if controls screen physical buttons assume roles equipment currently using example watch tv activity means im controlling directv receiver volume through sony amp therefore actions available screen physical buttons assume those roles way find hardware keys absolutely perfect controlling directv receiver likewise can choose watch smarttv activity bring up apps tv let select whatever app want physical keys while touchscreen displays smarttv control selections same ps3 wii xbox etc cycle through modes remote seamlessly offers appropriate control options pretty cool indeedfifth im not sure battery life such concern comes charging cradle seems like nobrainer youre not using remote just pop cradle no assuming most work kids if school has least portion day can let remote charge up right youre sleeping maybe just doesnt seem like should much concern longer term hope nonremovable battery lasts good long while im not too worried about itfinally ive more than pleasantly surprised well works granted im smart remote neophyte review take review grain two salt really truly found exceptional product plus fun grown up toy boot unless equipment really cannot controlled harmony products cant think major reason wouldnt recommend not inexpensive

through app old boom speaker displayed battery top device well battery widget speaker does neither just shows headphone icon top device no battery indicator does not appear anywhere batteries info settings widget im hoping just software bug fixed later update quite annoying coming boom speaker does show then again could intentional since can just ask alexa whats battery atbluetoothalexasoundim tying these final three into one category because seems somehow related together biggest concerns bugs inconsistencies hide aside issue battery indicator above bluetooth has excellent range doesnt appear flawless like im used other ultimate ear products has connection great solid no cutouts other weird sound artifacts however ive had instances bluetooth connection would just drop no reason seemed little inconsistent no rhyme reason completely random manually go into settings select megablast speaker connect againthis first alexa enabled device so definitly excited give try initially alexa joy use started obvious stuff would ask something like alexa siri hows weather today granted exactly wanted hear plus more voice found rather pleasing compared say siri alexa just seems much more natural nonrobotic then go having tell joke rap etc etc works great buti discovered issue using alexa while playing music audio already coming through speaker speaker playing audio issue alexa commandwhen shes donethe bluetooth connection justdrops every single time go into settings reconnect so only time can use alexa speaker isnt being used then ive more than likely got turned very disheartening really wanted implement alexa into music smart thermostat etc im really hoping just bug canwill fixed soonerthanlater firmware updateas sound found lot inconsistencies well playing music other audio noticed had turn speaker up louder than boom get same level volume out use megablast about half volume get same sound level 13 volume boom weird becauseisnt supposed loudest speaker offer appears speaker does better mid higher level volumes than lower mid level initially thought max volume speaker independant volume device because could say alexa change volume 10 volume bar device
