really liked these wanted keep because make one heck first impression ultimately had return removing lid box greets unmistakable smell brand new genuine leather thick headband ear cups baby soft premium leather way metal frame connects strong gives confidence theyre not going accidentally bend break anything almost intentional force against heres first comparison peers most every other set even over 300 almost completely plastic solid metal leather through through heavier than competitors thats already striking difference makes good argument higher price tag obviously higher quality product better materials also like ear cups removable magnetically attached should unrepairable break tear just buy new set pop underneath left cup cord attaches also great idea port tends get damaged cord pulled water seeps can tell lot thought put towards design picture doesnt do these justice impress top bottom one thing dont look like something want sweat over wear rainy days so something else gyms sweltering heat storm season outdoors theyre also softer than look ear pads filled memory foam so theyre very soft touch headband also nicely padded also like added thickness top did feel good first put felt discomfort during hours wearing clamping pressure started make upper jaw under ear ache seal very well isolate most outside noise theyre easily best noise isolating headphones ive ever put fold both sides fit easier small bag case making more portable ear cups dont swivel thoughill honest about sound say came away disappointed dont sound bad means theyre warmer mid range like sacrifices treble im used cycled through variety different types music comparing directly against audio technica m50xs didnt blow away kind expecting do given price point reputation then realized wasnt realistic expectation because m50xs actually very good headphones nothing going make sound like garbage thought p7s would outperform so well id just ditch completely didnt happen fact im now convinced probably not wise expect competent set headphones rendered obsolete more expensive set like these if good set already thats least over 100 200 up well established companies like sennheiser vmoda beyerdynamic bose audio technica sony etc intentionally omitting over priced overrated beats p7s wont completely redefine good sound least didnt once got over focused do well much do differently than already m50xs just notch above neutral bass treble no mids something like about these different flavor altogether mids lows much more pronounced pushing vocals forefront beck practically singing right front face played music stringed instruments classical jazz genres also received big boost extra attention cellos harps stand up basses were much fuller than other set ever told bass kicked electronic music daft punk deadmau5 up notches over ats well never got overbearing obnoxious really like deeper bass thicker overall sound bass heavy music im not bass head so dont want bass drowning out instruments vocals either sounds like getting close threshold going over edge never getting like lot rock music too something ats can do very well most bands actually sounded better than p7s probably due treble coming down couple notches prefer v shaped sound favoring treble bass fact usually treble dialed way up eqs so missed high sizzle cymbals snap snare drums also couldnt distinguish instruments well harder tunes heavier distortion guitars particularly heavy song high hat cymbal almost completely drowned out took m50xs remember much should hearing extra emphasis mids bass made sound fuller muddied separation p7s made most everything sound better outperformed m50xs just not rock category big one came up short according tastes headphones originally priced 400 shouldnt such glaring weakness should do everything really well dont main reason had let gooutside music p7s also worked well tv shows movies vocals came through clearly soundtracks effects delivered more home theater like experience extra oomph really delivered action scenes dialog more distinguishable m50xs held own while doing direct comparison thoughthere 2 cords provided one attached apple devices included controls worked flawlessly ipad cord even feels better comparison others ive felt drawback included case while nice receive one same fine leather found headphones im not fan soft cases especially not expensive electronics itll do fine around house light travel use if youre going put these suitcase travel far frequently id reservations these well worth little extra money protect falls drops getting sat being crushed other bags included soft case also looks more like one wifes makeup bags bit turn off thats very minor gripe thoughin conclusion these premium luxury headphones look like feel like smell like come short sounding like matters most if youve already invested decent set headphones wont completely redefine portable listening theyll provide quality product thats physically head shoulders above everything else ive seen store shelvesi still do recommend these people want premium build appreciate warmer sounds heavy vocals stringed instruments almost everything else theyre still very good hard rock achilles heel though im just like hearing separation amongst distortion now greater appreciation m50xs though going head head against high end headphone like p7 coming out top pretty remarkable even though tough decision main reason couldnt keep just couldnt justify paying 300 set headphones didnt completely outperform m50xs actually lacking treble like hurt extra clamping force sure nice looking,4,1
wasnt really sure about product mostly because bluetooth mic good would not im extremely impressed like can adjust sensitivity mic opinion worth money,5,1

despite best efforts scare off actually do like speaker lot unboxing speaker two things immediately struck first speaker smaller than id thought would based box lots packing materials keep safe second speaker feels surprisingly heavy given size only weighs little more than 2 pounds according kitchen scale feels lot heavier than youre holding hand got speaker blue one favorite colors blue duskier shade than expecting still pleasing eye being said do regret not having picked up black would coordinated furniture better texture lightly rubberized purports water resistant front speaker bears led light ring can customized hit range different colors speakers ports hidden behind door back righthand side came great big notice taped advising make sure door shut unit use can only presume ensure units water resistance seems operate perfectly fine door wide open surprising addition ports traditional usb type port should noted port power output only does not support power input data transfer documentation says port included charge ones phone tablet using speaker nice addition feels little random turning proved first stumbling block review following instructions charged device four hours prior attempting use speaker still plugged into wall pressed power button nothing happened tried pressing several times got no response whatsoever worried might received defective unit unplugging device wall pressing power button finally yielded results device promptly turning oddly only time encountered issue since left plugged pressed power button turns right away charging proved another oddity device using about two hours down 75 battery according phone app goes speaker speaker still plugged see about charging while using hour later app still reported battery status 75 im not sure whether characteristic device itself glitch phone app pairing device simple enough android phone did turn bluetooth off get show up suspect result bug phone not speaker app works speaker little too generic lacks polish things start go downhill first big selling point speaker ability wirelessly pair up synchronize other speakers series create stereo surround sound effect couldnt test only had single speaker work sony really ought consider selling these multipacks if theyre going make such big deal capability knew own research prior getting speaker capability only works other speakers series cant use other bluetooth speakers other manufacturers even other models sony speakers do being said language app very vague makes sound like can grab old bluetooth speaker create wireless speaker network curious see if actually case grabbed pair bluetooth speakers other manufacturers attempted pair sadly expected neither one would pair second apps control customizable led light ring isnt quite led believe given packaging documentation hope use speaker home theater system paired home theater pc rather than phone tablet given speakers ability link up other speakers id had thoughts about maybe using eventually implement wireless surround sound andor whole home speaker system pc setup has nice blue led lighting effect thought would cool get led ring speaker match blue rest setup has thats discovered second shortcoming app cant select single color led ring glow app only gives list preset color schemes can choose cycle through cant select just single color tell speaker hold continuously special psa lighting if youre epileptic dont attempt use speaker until adjust color settings default speaker came rave mode has white flashing strobes along left right edges no mention strobe effect materials read prior getting speaker little disturbing enabled default third voice control button within app doesnt appear actually do anything pressing prompts say keyword tried saying sony speaker hey play queens bohemian rhapsody had no luck getting app speaker react pressing help button within app didnt lead anything offering support saying google did pull up screen icons google music youtube couldnt get app do anything beyond point using voice controls unfortunately shortcomings arent limited just app speaker also has button top bass boost upon first using speaker very impressed sound clear loud lot punch curious see would sound like even more bass pressed bass button top sound immediately went flat tinny apparently bass button already enabled default given way set up bass button less boost button more make music sound anemic bad button perception would much improved had not opted enabled default using speaker phone call yielded mixed results audio came over both loud crystal clear end being said person other line said voice distant full distortion suffice say speakers microphone isnt very good couple warnings if youre going try use speaker pc first wont able control speakers settings pc youre going use phone app control things like power management led lighting secondly youre going want go into power management options within app turn off autooff power saving feature feature enabled default speaker doesnt automatically wake after powering down if dont turn off autooff then forced press power button speaker turn back after powers down amazing thing despite shortcomings ive listed still really like speaker led lighting fun sound terrific lots volume bass aesthetic nice clean speaker perfect no speaker really good yes despite shortcomings im

man do these make one heck first impression removing lid box greets unmistakable smell brand new genuine leather thick headband ear cups baby soft premium leather way metal frame connects strong gives confidence theyre not going accidentally bend break anything almost intentional force against heres first comparison peers most every other set even over 300 almost completely plastic solid metal leather through through thats already striking difference makes good argument higher price tag obviously higher quality product better materials also like ear cups removable magnetically attached should unrepairable break tear just buy new set pop underneath left cup cord attaches also great idea port tends get damaged cord pulled water seeps can tell lot thought put towards design picture doesnt do these justice impress top bottom one thing dont look like something want sweat over wear rainy days so something else gyms sweltering heat storm season outdoors theyre also much more comfortable than look ear pads filled memory foam so theyre very soft touch headband also nicely padded also like added thickness top while did feel little clampy first put never felt real discomfort during hours wearing also seal very well isolate most outside noise theyre easily best noise isolating headphones ive ever put fold both sides fit easier small bag case making more portable ear cups dont swivel thoughill honest about sound say little disappointed first cycled through variety different types music comparing directly against audio technica m50xs didnt blow away kind expecting do given price point reputation then realized wasnt realistic expectation because m50xs actually very good headphones nothing going make sound like garbage thought p7s would outperform so well id just ditch completely well didnt happen fact im now convinced probably not wise expect competent set headphones rendered obsolete more expensive set like these if good set already thats least over 100 200 up well established companies like sennheiser vmoda beyerdynamic bose audio technica etc intentionally omitting over priced overrated beats p7s wont completely redefine good sound least didnt once got over focused do well much do differently than already m50xs just slight notch above neutral bass treble no mids something like about these different flavor altogether mids lows much more pronounced pushing vocals forefront beck practically singing right front face played music stringed instruments classical jazz genres also received big boost extra attention cellos harps stand up basses were much fuller than other set ever told bass kicked electronic music daft punk deadmau5 up notches over ats well never got overbearing obnoxious really like deeper bass thicker overall sound bass heavy music im not bass head so dont want bass drowning out instruments vocals either sounds like right threshold going over edge never getting like lot rock music too something ats can do very well bands actually sounded better than p7s probably due treble coming down couple notches prefer v shaped sound favoring treble bass fact usually treble dialed way up eqs so missed high sizzle cymbals snap snare drums also couldnt distinguish instruments well harder tunes heavier distortion guitars push mids made sound fuller muddied separation little more most everything p7s did everything better outperformed m50xs just came up little short times according tastesoutside music p7s also worked great tv shows movies vocals came through clearly soundtracks effects delivered more home theater like experience extra oomph really delivered action scenes dialog more distinguishablethere 2 cords provided one attached apple devices included controls worked flawlessly ipad ipod cord even feels better comparison others ive felt one drawback included case while nice receive one same fine leather found headphones im not fan soft cases especially not expensive electronics itll do fine around house light travel use if youre going put these suitcase travel far frequently id reservations im ordering hard case just such uses these well worth little extra money protect falls drops getting sat being crushed other bags included soft case also looks more like one wifes makeup bags bit turn off thats very minor gripe thoughin conclusion these premium luxury headphones look like feel like smell like sound like if use already invested decent set headphones wont completely redefine portable listening theyll provide quality product thats head shoulders above everything else ive seen store shelves probably wouldve had buyers remorse had paid original 400 asking price these 280 cyber monday would take lot convince theres better made sounding headphone than bw p7 one those rare times getting pay turns out good thing highly recommended music listeners those appreciate little luxury every now thennote after cyber monday p7s went up 350 looks like new standard asking price still seems like pretty good deal keeps top heap price range,5,1
