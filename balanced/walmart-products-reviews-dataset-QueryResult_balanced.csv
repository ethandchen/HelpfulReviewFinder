I loved the better homes and garden sheets but they are not carrying them now in the store so I bought the Hotel Style 600 thread count sheet set in an ivory color.  They are the worst sheets.  They state to be 100 percent Egyptian cotton but they feel like sandpaper.  They wash up terrible and have so many wrinkles in them that if I were to keep them I would have to iron them.  Terrible sheets for the money paid.  I will be going elsewhere since Walmart decided to push these knock off brands instead of the better homes and garden sheets, which I might add wash up like a dream with no wrinkles and soft as could be.  Terrible decision on Walmarts part to push these in their place. If something works why  mess with it?  Geez...,1.0,1

These are sold as sized for a California King bed but the sewing makes them too tight to fit without great difficulty and they keep coming loose.

I received the sheets much later than was quoted (USPS was used), and when they finally arrived I barely opened the package to find threads all over, some attached and some of different colors mixed in. The quality of the stitching was very poor, and I sent back. I do not recommend buying this product.,1.0,1
After reading the reviews I wasnt expecting much,  but I was happy with what I recieved. First off.. it is light weight and kinda thin but I like that because I live in Florida and it's perfect for me because the weather here rarely goes below 60 degrees in the winter so once I put a down alternative comforter inside of it then I'm all set. As soon as I got it I put it in the washer and it held up great.,5.0,-1
good quality for a great price...since we live at the beach we needed a double vent at our pool and you won't find one at a better price in a variety of colors...the only downside is it is a pull up and not a crank,4.0,-1
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was worried about the quality for the price. It looks good but two of the rungs don't even fit into place when all is said and done, so basically its going to fall apart soon because its not totally secured as it should be. It looks good but seat is very firm as well.,2.0,1
I have owned MANY Keurig machines. The VUE being my favorite and I am so bummed I can't get that one anymore. I loved being able to get an orange machine this time but I am going to miss the auto on/off feature and having a clock. I love the smaller compact size though so will overlook the cons. I have only had this one day but I am sure it will work just as nicely as my other machines.,4.0,1

I bought this last month and disliked it from day one. I would put a pod in and it would show on the screen “water under pressure, please adjust pod or something close to that.

These chair cushion are beautiful, but brighter then the picture. Very nice pattern different then most.   I had hoped they were on the muted side.    The price is very good. A little thinner but not mush, the fabric is different then most, it seems that they might be warmer to sit on, color and pattern are clear.  All outdoor cushions fade no matter what you do.  I've bought fabric protector and sprayed all my outdoor fabric.  In this hot Auburn sun nothing will save from fading.  I'm tired of spending money on cushions and getting 2 years most (one year one side  the other side the second) I looked all over and everything is 3 times the price.  They seem a good deal.  For the price it is worth trying.  I did go to the store and returned these with no problem and bought another color and pattern I thought was more for me.,4.0,1

I bought this Keurig at Christmas time, loved the color Teal and it matched my kitchen perfectly. My old Keurig was almost 3 years old so I thought it was time for an upgrade. BIG mistake. I started getting the 'Brew interrupted, needle under pressure' error message after a couple of weeks of use, but would be ok after I went through the whole cleaning process. Then it started happening more frequently, then daily. So I called the 888 number. Customer service was great after I explained that I did everything Google told me to do to fix the problem. The good news was they'd send me a new one out, bad news no Teal. No biggie. Receive a Pearl White one and very first time using it, get the same error. Go through the whole cleaning process and still ERROR. So I call again, they'd said they'd send another Pearl White one. I got it yesterday and it was Black AND second cup of coffee, SAME ERROR MESSAGE and coffee grounds in my coffee. So now what?????,1.0,1

Have 350 model but this isn't listed anymore. Less than a yr after purchase it quit reading labels and began to reject Keurig brand k-cups. Called in & was told this was not possible and I was just not cleaning the machine properly. This was not first one I owned and it was being cleaned regularly and properly. Keurig wouldn't replace - instead sent a "cleaning kit" which was useless. Husband is furious that it requires putting K-cup in and out anywhere from 5 to 10 times before machine will read. Isn't worth the aggravation and wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy. It's a shame - we loved our original Keurig which gave out from constant use.,1.0,1

We use a Keurig primarily for when just one person is going to have a cup or when we have company over and we want to offer both caffeinated or decaffeinated. Our old Keurig broke and so we decided to venture into the world of 2.0. We ordered this one in orange (to my wife's joy), and within a week, it was giving us significant grounds in the coffee. We called customer support, went through some tests, and then they sent us new one. We received the new one and within the first or second brew, we had grounds! We went through tests again and to no avail. We asked customer support to send us a different and upgraded Keurig - which they did, and we are within a week of that one. So far, so great. That said, there must be some type of defect with this type of Keurig. I can't imagine we received the two totally odd ones in a batch.,1.0,1

I had my 2.0 for about two months when it started to just drip coffee, got stuck in preheat even after the tank was full.

We have had this mattress for almost a month.  It is absolutely the best mattress we have ever had.  I normally prefer a firmer mattress, but the gel foam provides good support without being hard.  My husband has back problems and was very hesitant about ordering a mattress online and finding out that he may not be able to sleep on it.  He has slept better than he has in 20 years and is very happy with this mattress.   The mattress had a chemical smell when we first unpackaged it.  The smell dissipated within a week.

We really love the Chefman Anti-Overflow Waffle Maker! It comes with a cup to measure the perfect amount of batter and it was so easy, my 10-year old made waffles before I even got to it!

I've owned these for four months and they're the most disappointing quality. Instead of becoming softer with washing, they've become scratchy and after about 2 months it started to get those little balls. Horrible.

I was fully aware to expect a budget hose, but was still a terrible purchase.
When looking at expandable hoses, they all seemed to look the same. This one had decent reviews, was priced cheap, and I expected something that was only worth $10. This is not worth the time I am spending to write this review. Hope it helps someone not make the same mistake.
1) Came in a single clear wrap, with one stickers barcode that I tried to scan with multiple apps to no avail
2) The product description is a far stretch of the imagination
3) As soon, literally within 10 seconds, a bubble formed and popped the hose & green wrap around it. (I did not have the water even of half of the strength it could push),1.0,1

I would not pay more than $20 for this cabinet. It actually looks used. The edges are all scratched. The cabinet doors donât match the other wood. It is poorly made.

If you like cooking, but are short on time, this is a product for you. I found it way easier to cook chicken on here than cook chicken on the stove.

I would recommend this grill for individual use, not for family or group grilling.,5.0,1
Ok, the rug was lower priced online than in the store, a plus. It arrived earlier than expected, another plus! However, when I unrolled it, I noticed a 2" grey stain! Ugh! The color is fresh ivory! C'mon. Overall, I like it and hid the stain under furniture. Would I do it again? Yah, sure.,1.0,1

I love the look of this chair (I got blue). The blue (maybe more of a pale aqua) thread runs throughout, so the whole chair looks somewhat blue with the flowers much more so. It was relatively easy to put together. I will say the chair is deep (the part you sit on), but it is short, both in height between the seat and the ground and on the part you lean your back on. I have long legs and think it sits great, maybe a tad short. I'm short in the torso, though, and the back fits me perfectly, so others may find it too short. It provides great lumbar support, though the back is very squeaky inside (nothing you can get to to try and fix). It's a fairly firm seat. Overall I'm pleased, but the dimensions to make it look a tad off from the side, but the beautiful color makes up for it.,4.0,1

This is one thing I had no idea that I needed!  My son is all over his bed.  Once we got him the toddler pillow, he knew exactly what to do with it...lay his head on it.  He doesn't always end up on it by the morning but he loves it.  I feel like it's very safe and feels very soft.,5.0,1

Purchased these for our personal use in our family room around a game table. Was considering folding chairs but wanted something a little more durable. These are really nice, a little firm at first but comfortable, great back support, very sturdy and easy to put together (we did have all the pieces required). Did a lot of research prior and even with a high shipping price, they were still cheaper than any other site. I am looking for some sort of cover for the bottoms of the legs to make them able to slide over the carpet better but am overall very happy with the purchase,5.0,1

This is a super Belgian Waffle Maker, and it performs much better than I thought it would. It evenly browns and the moat really does prevent over flow. That said, anytime you go overboard in the amount of batter your put in, you will have a mess on your hands. This is a super iron, I have yet to put any sort of oil or anything on the waffle grids. It really is non stick. Super supper waffle iron.,5.0,-1

I got a Keurig K200 for Christmas. It is way easier to use than my old espresso maker, and I love that I can choose a color other than black or white (yay turquoise!) as well as pick coffee, tea, cocoa, or hot water. The water takes about a minute to preheat from a cold start (only two seconds if it's been preheated earlier) and about another minute to completely finish brewing a 10oz K-cup set for strong. The brew size does depend on if you're using a cup, mug, or carafe pod (K-cup only goes up to 10oz) however you could do 6oz and 6oz to get a 12oz size, 10oz then 4oz for 14oz, or 10oz and 6oz for a 16oz for the K-cups to get a larger size. Personally I prefer the 10oz K-cup as I like to have room to add cream and sugar or whipped cream without worrying about anything spilling over. Although older K-cups won't work in the newer brewers, you could solve the problem by using an accessory like 2.0 My K-Cup to put the older K-cup's coffee in or find an equivalent coffee in one of the newer K-cups. So far, I haven't had any trouble with coffee grounds in my cup or water spilling into the tray, but I did check my cup sizes first and I wait patiently for it to finish completely. It's quite new so I haven't had to change the filter or descale yet. I like how the instruction manual covers everything and has a problem solving guide in easy steps. Really the only trouble can be the total cost, as accessories such as the carafe ($20-$30) and 2.0 My K-cup ($15) are not included, as well as storage for the pods ($25-$30), although the cost of the coffee for the maker is much cheaper than the amount I was spending (generally less than $1 per K-cup versus about $5 for one 14-16oz cup). All in all, I'm very happy with my new (turquoise) Keurig coffee maker!,5.0,1
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Everything about this umbrella gets a top notch rating from me! It looks great, operates smoothly, and was a very good deal at 20% off plus free shipping! I should also mention that I was looking for an umbrella with the fewest moving parts, so as to avoid breakage, ie, no crank, but instead a manual lift, and no tilt on the pole either. Fills the bill nicely!,5.0,-1
This is the worst brewer I have bought. This is my 4th Keurig I have purchased and this is by far the one I hate. I have had it replaced once already. I buy most of my coffee on the Keurig site and only a few actually work in the brewer. I am one to try new coffee and now I can't for fear it will not brew in this brewer. Can't wait until it breaks so I can get a different one.,1.0,1
After finally being able to fit the plastic piece on to the faucet and turned on the hose and was finally able to use the hose it then splits at the top and the plastic tubing inside broke off at the nozzle inside. To say that I am not happy would be putting it mildly as the hose was just unpacked and hooked up and broke the very first time it was used.,1.0,1

These rugs are American made and the fiber is tough yet does not hold water. They are fast drying after cleaning and stain and chemical (bleach) resistant. Don't do it just for fun. They are slip resistant and stay where you put them. However, it took mine almost a week to lay flat on some edges after unpacking and rolling them out. I bought the brown and it is a very pleasing rich brown. I have 2 inside and one on my porch that gets afternoon sun. I am watching it for fading on that side, none yet. The Florida sand and sun can be brutal. I like these too much to leave it outside if I see any fading start. They feel nice under the feet, hence the one moved to the sitting area outside.

The shipping was fast and my transaction was flawless.,5.0,1

2 things to be cautious of...1) These are deep pocket sheets 2) the color doesn't match the website.
They don't tell you  on the website description about them being deep pocket and I got one of those bed in a boxes that isn't deep. Very frustrating. Ending up giving to my brother and SIL and they really liked it. keeps them cool but left me frustrated and still looking.,3.0,1

I bought these sheets over the weekend. It cost more than I expected for a Walmart item but I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt. They look great in the package and it said it was 600 thread ct. Egyptian cotton. I didn't think I could go wrong.

We brought it home, washed it, add fabric softener and it still felt like sand paper. What a waste of $$$. 

The next day I went to Costco and bought way better sheet for half the price and only 400 thread ct. and they feel like silk (100% cotton).

BUYER BEWARE, DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$$,1.0,1
These sheets are terrible to sleep on. Very scratchy on the skin. After I purchased the sheets I washed them according to directions. They fit beautifully my bed. I love the deep pockets and the full elastic banding. I have slept on them for 2 night now and needless to say i have not slept good at all. Last night by 1am i was ripping the sheets and pillowcases off of my bed and replacing them with my old sheets! I will be returning them ASAP. I spent nearly $100 for thr sheet set plus a coordinating service of king pillowcases. Not at all worth the money. I only gave them 2 stars because I like the functional design of the fitted sheet. Other than that they are terrible,2.0,1
I purchased this chair to be used in a guest bedroom. It arrived 3 days later than what was represented on the Walmart website when I ordered it. When it arrived it appeared to have no legs or attachment hardware. I contacted Walmart and they immediately sent me a replacement. The second chair also arrived with what appeared to be no legs or hardware, however, when my husband was turning the seat over he felt something under the black cloth attached on the bottom of the seat cushion. On closer inspection we saw that the black cloth was attached with velcro and not stapled. We pulled off the black cloth and wedged deep into the seat was a box containing the legs and attachment hardware. On the first chair the box was wedged so deep into the seat it could not be felt. There were no directions in the box or even a picture to tell you the legs were in the seat and concealed under the black cloth (the directions were in the box with the legs) which would have been helpful. The chair I bought is in ivory and I like the pattern and the neutral color. It is comfortable and seems sturdy, however, it is a little lower to the ground than I expected. Also, one leg seemed a little short, when placed on a hard surface. I am putting it in a carpeted bedroom and it sits squarely when placed on a carpet. I decided to keep both chairs. With the second chair, all four legs set squarely on a hard surface but my husband had a problem with one of the bolts and could only get it to screw in 3/4 of the way, however, it does not seem to affect the sturdiness of the chair. Considering the price, I would buy these chairs again,4.0,1

I bought this for our 1 year old daughter because she loves to rock and she loves to read. It is a very sturdy chair and I was happy I didn't have to put it together. It arrived in a timely manner.I was disappointed that the staple holes were not filled and that there are some rough edges on the rungs. It is smooth where she sits and holds on, so thankful for that. Just disappointed that it isn't as professionally finished as I expected. [*] But this was made in the USA. Come on guys!For the price I expected more.,2.0,1

I'm very disappointed with my new Keurig machine. I was excited to make a cup of coffee until it smelt like burnt plastic and tasted like it also.

We bought the Keurig 2.0 and were so excited to use it. We got two in one day, both having the same problems. Here's our issue: 1. Leaves a lot of coffee grounds in the coffee. I had read that the needle is puncturing the K-cup filter. Poor design. This was the biggest issue because it's undrinkable. 2. Sometimes it makes the right amount, but most of the time it's way off. We brew 10 ounces and only get 4-6 back. 3. It ONLY uses Keurig brand coffee. Which isn't a major problem but a little annoying if we want to try other brands. 4. It brews hot, but not hot enough. Coffee makers are supposed to brew hotter than the consumer can stand to allow for adequate cooling, and allows for adding of refrigerated creamers. So what happens is my coffee now gets cold very fast. Previous Keurig's we've owned did not have this problem. 5. We have had it one day and it no longer dispenses coffee. The screen continues to read "error" even though we have done everything by the book. Will be returning for a previous model. To add a positive note, I loved the option to make the coffee stronger, and it did exactly that! Disappointed in this model, but looking forward to Keurig hopefully making a better version.,1.0,1

Hotel Brand 600 Thread Count Sheet Set - Cream,Queen - 5 Stars!!

Queen Set Includes - (1 Fitted Sheet "60 x "80 ) - (1 Flat Sheet 94" x 104" ) - (2 Pillowcases 21" x "32 each )

With - OPTIFIT Technology fits mattresses up to 20 in. deep.

I chose the Queen size sheets in the Cream color to review. Received my Hotel Brand 600 Thread Count Sheet Set packaged inside a zippered clear plastic fitted covering. It was delivered inside of a cardboard box approximately of the same size. I just love the cream color , very rich and luxurious look and feel. The instructions direct you to wash your sheet set first before first use. Instructs to wash in warm water with like colors and NO bleach. Tumble dry low, Iron on low as needed.
Upon making bed I really like the ease of stretch and deep pockets . I have had other sheets of around the same price but definitely not of same quality and comfort that my Hotel Brand 600 Thread Count Sheet Set provide me. These sheets are of great quality and the comfort and sheen looks and feels like I have spent way much more money than I did. The smoothness and softness had me sleeping in comfort .Even though I received this Hotel Brand 600 Thread Count Sheet Set free to review, I will definitely buy them for my family and home in the near future .

I happily give Hotel Brand 600 Thread Count Sheet Set , Queen, Cream - 5 STARS!!,5.0,1
Wow is all that can say to describe this mattress! It comes rolled up in a box that is about 5 feet long and weighs around 100 pounds. When you open the box and follow the instructions you roll out the mattress which is compressed to only a few inches thick. At that point t you can cut open the package sealing it. That's when the fin began it started to instantly grow and ends up being over 14 inches. I was amazed watching this grow back to size. The mattress does have a smell to it after opening but this does go away. The mattress is so comfortable and conforms to your body. I have had amazing nights sleep on this. My husband woke up the first night and felt awesome he also noticed that he was taller, his spine had streatched out from the bed conforming to him. We've been sleeping on it over a week now and I love it. I must warn you though that purchasing the low profile box spring is a good idea if you have pets who sleep in bed with you. The mattress with out normal boxspring is pretty high but don't let this deter you from purchasing. This is an amazing mattress!,5.0,1
We ordered these to replace the cushions on our outdoor swing. The old ones had faded and looked dingy. These cushions were by far the best price for a quick fix of our outdoor porch!,5.0,1
I use this replacement product for home use daily. Used for tea and coffee. I loved the 1st one I bought, it lasted 15 months. the new one had problems within the 1st month...the replacement I was sent has had problems with plugging since day one. I believe it was refurbished and not brand new. It also has a weak spring that doesn't hold the lid up so I can put the k-cup in....disappointed and disillusioned after such a good experience with my 1st product in 2014....,1.0,1
WARNING.  Don't waste your money on these expensive rugs.  These rugs shed so much that it clogs and breaks washing machines and dryers, causing expensive repairs.  I always clear the filters ands it was still too much shedding for the filters and hoses to hold.  It takes at least 70 minutes to dry in a new dryer.  The rugs absorb moisture in the bathroom and takes a long time to dry, causing mildew and odor.,1.0,-1
I tried to like this cabinet, but the smell is still too strong. I let it aired out for weeks and wiped with water several times, but I still can't get rid of the smell.  The cabinet is easily wobbled when opening the doors even when it is wall mounted. I don't recommend if you have little children.,2.0,1

This Duvet set is exactly what I was looking for! It is beautiful and comes with a matching pillow sham. The other thing I like about it is that the zipper for the duvet is hidden by a flap of material.

I bought this as a wedding gift to my son along with about 10 boxes of tea/coffee. He had to bring me back almost 1/2 the boxes because they will not work in the new machine? that makes no sense especially since i bought off the Keurig website. not good all at,2.0,1
I have loved keurig for years now. I recently saw the 2.0 in the store and bought it for my office. However, the downside that I have is that I have many pods that Kuerig does not have that it will not let me use. I wish that there would have been some sort of disclaimer on it because that would have possibly changed my mind about buying it. Also, I have been having an issue with a small amount coffee grounds ending up in my cup when it brews. I have used the maintenance tool multiple times and it has not alleviated it.,3.0,1
Bought it about 3 weeks ago and love it! I've wanted one for awhile but waited because I didn't know if my husband would object. He started making drinks immediately and does so every day.,5.0,1
This is my second review. I wrote the first one with the promise from Keurig that I would get free coffee. They denied receiving my review and would not send me my coffee. Aside from that, I am basically happy with my brewer. I do find that if you put cream in your coffee, the coffee is instantly too cold. I was told my the company to put hot water in the cup to warm it first to help with this issue. Over all, it is convenient and tastes great.,4.0,1

Noisy, difficult to fill the tank (tank will not clear my upper kitchen cabinets if I try to remove), condensation drips everywhere when you remove lid to tank, on strong setting it spews coffee grounds every where, can use only Keurig brand cup (which is not the best coffee in the world), packaging is misleading - thought I would be able to brew 5 different sizes but not without using a different size K-cup which don't seem to be available anywhere.  Brewer is so light weight that when you lift the handle to insert the pod the whole coffee maker lifts up.  Tank is too small.  Only purchased this coffee brewer because I wanted a white one to coordinate with my kitchen.  Too expensive for how cheaply made it seems to be.  Prices of this model have dropped at local retailers.,1.0,1

positive: external size and appearance excellent in kitchen. We wanted a smaller MW these dimensions.
negative: compared with our previous small MW and with our present GE Spacemaster, the edges of the door are poorly finished and frequently pinch or cut fingers.

I purchased Kuerig coffee pots for all of our children and they loved them so decided to get one for my husbands birthday. I bought tbe K200 from Walmart because of the compact size and we have a small kitchen. The first few cups of coffee were good but within days we had so many grounds we couldnt drink it. Took it back and exchanged ut but had the same problem immediately. This time we called Kuerig and they agreed to replace the pot. We received the new pot todat (our 3rd) and we still get grinds. Called customer service and they are sending us another pot (#4) however i would prefer a refund but since we didnt but it from their website they cannot give us a refund. I wish we had never called Kuerig and had just returned the pot to the store. I cant tell you how many pods we havewasted.

We ordered the Cadet Grey - Right sectional. The sofa is perfect! Very modern looking. It came it two pieces. The sectional pieces do not latch/connect together. We don't have any problem with that but some people may. The color is true to the listing. While we strongly recommend this sofa to everyone, we highly recommend not purchasing it through Hayneedle. A few days after purchasing the sectional, we received an email that it was backordered (mind you, the listing gave no indication that this was the case). It would be an extra month or so until we got it. We decided to stay the course as we loved the design and look of it. About a week later we received an email that the sofa had shipped (about 2.5 weeks earlier than expected). Surprised, we emailed Hayneedle customer service and asked them to verify this. They replied that there was a mistake and issued us a new order number. Eventually the sofa shipped on the projected backorder date. We also purchased the "white glove" service which included them delivering it to the room of our choosing in our apartment. We scheduled delivery for a Monday from 1pm to 5pm. I left work in order to be home to receive the sofa. Around 4pm I received a call that there was a mistake and my new time was the next day from 10am to 2pm. Again, I took off work to be home. The delivery man arrived and told me that he was only instructed to drop off the sofa and leave (we live on the 6th floor of an apartment building in downtown Denver...). He offered to let me speak with his manager, who told me that Hayneedle contracts them specifically to drop off and leave; this specific delivery company does not do any "white glove" service. Having gone through all of this, we opted to have him leave the sofa and take it up ourselves so that we could finally have somewhere to sit. I am HIGHLY disappointed in Hayneedle's customer service with this order and will have to think long and hard before giving them my business again.,1.0,1

Wanted to like product; replaced Vue after it stopped working after 18months. This machine worked for two weeks and then began dispersing coffee at irregular amounts, overfilling cups the last few mornings. (I now have one on standby to collect the liquid so it saves my countertops.) Keurig is sending a replacement, but I lost confidence in the machine already. Moving on to a new brand the next time I need a Unit, and suspect that may be sooner rather than later.,2.0,1

Works as well as high quality Japanese name brands of equal caliber but without non-stick coating. Also, price is less. I prefer to cook Jasmine brown/mixed rice. I use provided measuring cup which is same measurement as other Asian rice cookers (slightly less than US cup size). For 3 cups of uncooked Jasmine brown /mixed rice, I fill with water to 4 or slightly over as marked on inside of stainless steel inner pot. Rice turns out perfect every time. Clean up is easy. If rice is stuck, soak with warm water with or w/o added soap for a few minutes. Lid is easy to clean with removable stainless lid plate. I gave 4 stars because I have only used it for less than 2 months for an almost daily basis. I purchased extended warranty just in case. If this goes on sale I may purchase as gifts for Christmas.,4.0,1

This cabinet is great, we use it as medicine cabinet and for odds and ends. It would be great for clothes, toiletries, books, supplies, even groceries, etc. It's pretty sturdy. The shelves are about 1/2 inch thickness, not flimsy like some drawer bottoms are. 

It took a bit of time, like about 30-45 minutes for my husband and I to put it together. The outer panels took long to put on because the screws use a L shape tool to put them on and that tool is not as easy to use as a screwdriver. It came with clear enough instructions and was easy to assemble. 

It did have a few scratches and some peeling at the end of the doors since it's pressed wood. It also attracts a lot of dust being black and all. All and all we are happy with it.,4.0,1

I usually like Hamilton Beach products, but I'm not totally happy with this one.
While it cooks the burger and chicken just the way I like it and perfect for one or two, the top around the handle builds up steam and drips on the counter table surface. Yes, the drip tray is in place, but not wide enough to avoid this.

I emailed Hamilton Beach and this is their response, "We will be happy to assist you. We apologize for any inconvenience you have experienced. The condensation coming from the cooking unit is not a manufacturing defect. We recommend opening the lid during the cooking process to release any built up steam."

I bought the contact grill so it would be easy to cook, no turning the meat, so why would I lift the lid to fix that problem? I use a towel underneath to avoid it. I suggested the drip tray be across the whole front to avoid this. Not happy with their response.

I will use this grill as it is a nice compact size for one (mainly), but won't buy another when this gives out.,3.0,1

As a Keurig mini owner, I upgraded to the k250 and it is way better. The water reservoir is removable and easy to clean which was a previous issue with the Keurig Mini because the water reservoir for the Mini is non-removable. This makes it hard to clean especially with mineralization. Since I am an everyday coffee drinker and am now addicted to caffeine, I was pleasantly surprised when there was a "strong" setting. It also has setting for "Hot Cocoa" and other which I was also surprised by. Definitely going to purchase some other types of Kcups because of that. In comparison to the Mini, the clearance for cup sizes is more versatile. The Mini can really only accommodate short mugs while I can fit my tall thermos under K250. Overall, it's a little bigger than the Keurig Mini but it's size is fair in terms of brewing systems. I currently have the black one and it looks great on the countertop. Nothing too flashy. Easy to use because the touch screen prompts you questions. I would definitely recommend!,5.0,1

I was very excited to find this anti-overflow waffle maker. Having had waffle makers in the past, I finally got rid of them because of the overflow problem. This design is genius!

This replaced a single flood light over a bar in my kitchen. I had to buy a separate adapter kit that allow the wiring to 'screw' into my existing fixture. Tricky to get device attached - you need three hands or a helper....but job was straight forward. Instructions clear. I wanted more light than given by the 100W flood I was replacing. I realize now that 30W would have been sufficient rather than the 50W bulbs I ordered. The ability to point the individual lights also let me light up a telephone near the bar.,5.0,-1

sure, i got them during a Christmas special last year, 2014, and i have used on and off rotating with others of higher and lower price/TC, etc. however, that means i use 4 times during the year. agree that the more you launder little balls, and thread pulls appear not the softness! now this month i go to put on and there is a rip the size of 1/2 the fitted sheet! i don't know now i missed it when i was folding, but it goes in the recycle bin.,2.0,1

I ordered these, the couch and chair covers, 2 months ago, hoping to have them on my furniture as company began to arrive.  I finally received the chair cover a couple weeks ago (and I love it) but still I have no couch cover and keep being told it is on BO, by the date they are now saying it will be 3 months and maybe I will never get it at all.  I have shopped Lakeside for years  and have been pleased, but right now I am a bit upset......I would have given a 5 had I gotten my couch cover.

Not even close to expectations.  I can read a newspaper through them and they are just about impossible to put on!  These "deep pockets" don't fit any better than my regular set of sheets.  Too bad I ordered the wrong size first (never even opened it) so ordered correct size second time around.  Big waste of $ IMHO.  Too expensive (heavy) to return...can't return to Wal-Mart so will go to Good will or some such organization.,1.0,-1
When I first bought this it was called the K250 but now is no longer shown. Now it's called the K2o. It is cheaply made. This is my 3rd replacement in less than 3 months. Pieces were missing in the 1st two and now I'm waiting for the 3rd to arrive however no longer available in the color I originally orddered so stuck with ugly colors to coose from. Also was not offered the decals it shows with the machine. Have had nothing but problemd due to poor craftsmenship. It's loud, takes a long time to preheat, constantly have to clean it. I don't have anything good to say about this product except they're replacing the former ones I've had problems with but still have not been offered any type of special compensations for all the problems I've had with these machines. Would not recommend ordering this machine.,1.0,1

I am sad that this machine does not live up to the hype. First and foremost is the fact that the pods I had from previous machine do not work w this model. That leaves me with dozens of now wasted pods,money gone. Next is the no shut off feature( am now unplugging) which not only uses electricity,but I find the machine stays very warm,which worried me. I also am disappointed that I no longer get a full cup of coffee,but maybe half to 3/4 that I got w my single serve. As I have tossed the box and packing slip(my bad,thought it would be keeper like others) am seriously considerin g purchasing another brand of coffee maker/Brewer and putting this away in storage(maybe bring out if having major company). Did I also mention this is much noisier while brewing than previous models?! Sorry Keurig,this misses the mark with me.,3.0,1

I ordered this rug to replace a shag rug i had ordered from another store. They no longer carry it, and I found what I thought was the same one (same brand and description, including the material used in the rug) on walmart.com. This is a cheaper version of a shag rug. It does not feel soft to the touch. Instead the fibers are quite coarse and rough. It does look the same as the better rugs (mostly) so I was still planning to keep it, but as I unrolled it I started to see large areas where it was stained/discolored. I will be returning this rug.,1.0,1

This sheet set does not feel like a $35 sheet set.... $10 sheet set more like it.  The fitted sheet fits too big, not a snug fit.  I've washed these for the first time and already the fabric has some weird spots like the thread has gotten snagged.  The pillow cases have lost its shape and I haven't even slept on them yet.  I wanted to wash them before sleeping on them.  The feel of the fabric is just weird, I guess I know not to purchase microfiber again.  All this is even before I have slept on them.,1.0,-1

Ordered 50 of these chairs for the youth room at our church. Pros: The chairs look nice and are comfortable to sit in. They are light weight and easy to move around which is important for us. The price was great. Cons: Another reviewer noted that the padding is a bit hard at first. But, I really think this is a preference issue; I thought the support felt good, but might change my mind after sitting for an hour. Beware of the pattern. The picture on the internet does not show up too well. The chairs actually look slightly different in person, having some little blue dots interspersed throughout the pattern. Unknowns: Our kids are hard on chairs and I'm anxious to see how long these chairs last. They seem sturdy, but only time will tell.,4.0,1
I bought this as a replacement to my first Keurig maker that lasted over 4 years!  I am not as pleased with this one!  I wish that I had paid more attention to the size of the water reservoir tank!!  While 40oz sounds like a lot, it is not.  I'm constantly having to add water!! Trust me, for that "first" morning cup, especially waking up for work.... You don't want to read that dreaded message "add more water".  If you drink at least 3 cups of coffee a day - you will be disappointed in this maker due to the size of the water tank.  While I love Keurig makers, I'm stuck with this one until it wears out.  Choose another model for all  you true coffee lovers!!,2.0,1

Hotel Brand 600 Thread Count Sheet Set are soft and silky feeling and will make you feel like you are in a five star hotel. This is an elegant sheet set that I must say is made just for high end hotels. I felt like a queen while sleeping on these 600 thread count material of Egyptian cotton. The sheets are great for winter as they keep you warm and I would think they are good for warm weather as they are so very breathable. The sheets are great for your master bedroom or for any of your guest rooms. What every room or bed you place those on they will become a great addition to the room and to your linen collection. You may think this are just some ordinary sheets with a little fancy threads running through them, but you will soon find out that once you sleep on them they hold up to what is said about them. While lying on the Hotel Brand 600 thread count sheet set you will feel like you are being pampered in a whole new world. You skin will feel soft and beautiful and they will be the only sheets you want to sleep on after trying them out. I would recommend them to everyone.,5.0,1

I bought two of these.  The one I put in front, the washer shifted or something and the second time I used it, it leaked all over the place.  I used it 3 or 4 more times and it got a hole in the hose.  This was not around children and was not misused to cause the hole.  I put the second one in the back.  It last 2 weeks, then developed a hole just before the hose connects to the nozzle.  It leaks all over the place.  Do not buy this product, unless you only need something temporary, because temporary is all you will get.  The nozzle works great!,1.0,1

This Bed is beautiful. If you are teetering on the edge about ordering this bed as an internet purchase( like I was, I like to be able to see and touch before i buy), dont hesitate. While I have to admit I was not the one to put it together, the 2 guys that did said they could not believe how strong the steel frame was. They said it was VERY well built. I ordered the Charcoal color and it is close to a black color. The bed definately takes center stage in our large bedroom and I am completely satisfied with my purchase. You will not be dissapointed in this bed.,5.0,1

Looks nice, affordable alternative to a sofa. I bought the 6 inch coil futon mattress. For me it will take 2 people to fold into sofa position. It is comfortable to sit on, I can lay on it without folding it down. I do not use it for sleeping, I use it as a sofa. I picked is up at the store in my chevy impala with the back seat folded down. I opened the box, and carried the pieces up to my 3rd floor apartment easily. No instructions included, have to download. Once you get started putting it together it goes quite easily. Takes a minute to get all the different bolts, and pieces figured out. Biggest headache was figuring out which way the folding hinge went on as the picture is not real clear. I did not tighten bolts until I was sure I had things right. I was able to assemble myself, had to place in sitting position without the mattress, then place the mattress on it.,5.0,1

I am a frequent buyer, and I love all of Little Colorado's quality products, because of the sturdy pine wood construction. I can always count on them to send the very best, and in a timely fashion. This chest is a good size, but is relatively light weight at only 41 pounds and comes fully assembled. Kids love the design, because it resembles a Pirate's chest and it is easily painted. The center safety hinge and front opening make it safe for children. I would definitely recommend this product to buyers above all others that I have seen on the market, and the reasonable price seals the deal!,5.0,-1

I have used the Keurig in the past when it first came out and I was pretty impressed. I had a small one but that one unfortunately broke. I stop by Dunkin Donuts every morning to pick myself up a Medium HOT Latte. Well let me JUST SAY…NOT ANYMORE. Go pick yourself up Keurig 2.0 immediately! Some may think I am crazy but I brought my Keurig 2.0 to work to share with my co-workers. I also purchased the reusable pod so I can pack whatever coffee I like versus buying the pods. Compare my $3+ daily run from Dunkin or getting a box of 12 pods for $8.00 which equals out to .67 cents a day…which route would you choose? Honestly speaking, I was so used to Dunkin Donuts that I thought I liked it! Well after taking a week break from Dunkin and then picking one up on the way home one afternoon (It was a long day at work) I was so unhappy. I needed my coffee from my Keurig. I have seen and read reviews about the old K-Cups not working on the 2.0 versions. I have not had an issue. I bought my reusable pod but I have also used K-Cups from the 1.0 and it worked just as fine on the 2.0. I love this Coffee Machine and I am looking forward to purchasing another one. I will need it for my home! I will purchase the Carafe with it this time.,5.0,1

these are not bamboo sheets, the tag on them says "bamboo feel fiber".  they are not 1800 thread count, the name on the package is 1800 luxury sheets. they are extremely thin and the elastic on the fitted sheet isn't even sewn in place (by that I mean the elastic is free to move inside the folded over edge and you can feel it redistributing itself as you put it on the mattress). the only pro is they do fit my mattress, which is the only thing that's true in the description, they are sheets and they are queen size.,1.0,1

This is absolutely the worst brewer Keurig makes. You may get a ½ of a cup of coffee or it almost overflows. And if you want to make more than one cup of coffee, you will have to unplug the brewer and start over. I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE BUYING THIS MODEL. It is a waste of money!,1.0,1

This rug arrived really dirty in one corner. I'm a stay at home mom and I don't have the ability to just cram a huge rush into my car with two kids and drag it back to Walmart. I think I can get the dirt out with a little elbow grease but I was so eager to use my rug, I just hid the ugly under my couch. I think they need to improve the packaging on this product, instead of just putting it in some thin plastic wrap. I'm giving this 3 stars because I think it is unacceptable for a brand new item to arrive dirty. Other than that I really love this rug. Feels so nice. My baby loves it too and I think it's helping him explore textures. I'm actually ordering another so that I can line it up next to the one I have. Makeshift frieze carpet! Still: three stars for the DIRT!,3.0,1
Product arrived quickly. I washed them in warm water and dried on the regular setting and they fit really well. The pockets are deep and stay on the mattress all night even with a person with restless legs, a toddler and another tossing and turning adult. The sheets are soft and feel great! I would recommend these sheets.,5.0,1
This fitted sheet barely fits over my normal height king mattress. If anything, it shouldn't be advertised as deep pocket. I ordered it for my mattress and mattress topper and like I said , it doesn't even fit fully around a normal king mattress.,1.0,-1
This is a great set, but people please be aware that this is NOT a comforter set.,4.0,1
Works as advertised. Only wish it had a beeper when done instead of a light that you have to be nearby to see.,5.0,-1
So, I have had two sets of these. Initially, I loved them. However,  I now have two complains. First, after you step on them the "pebbles" lose their definition and the rug looks kind of sloppy. No prob. Shake it out after your done. In a family of four good luck with that. They also can get moldy quickly and need lots of washing. They wash up ok, but need lots of dry time and make tons of lint in the trap. Also, the two lightest colors blend into the background once walked on. Love the size and the look brand new so would be perfect for guest bath, if you have it or any light use bath.,3.0,1
These are nice sheets but donât stay on! We have an adjustable base and these end up wadded. Customer service is a joke. I contacted them twice for a refund and they never responded. Will never purchase from them again! Love my Amazon sheets so much more!,3.0,-1
This sheet set is made from 100% Egyptian cotton. The thread count is 600 adding some weight to a king size set. Hotel Brand incorporates "Optifit Technology" for a secure fit for a 9 to 20 inch deep mattress. It also has stretch corners for a smooth fitted sheet appearance. This product is made in India and the quality is very good!

The sheet set was washed and dried after before fitting them on our bed. My first impression was they felt rather "crisp" compared to our older sheets. They also made a noise when rubbing against each other and when you change your sleeping position through out the night. Both of these characteristics do not deture from being very comfortable.

I like these sheets very much and would not hesitate replacing our sheets we presently own with another set of Hotel Style 100% Egyptian Cotton with Sateen Weave. I certainly love the feel of these sheets and look forward to sleeping in them every evening.,5.0,1
After 4 tries I finally received a brewer that works. Originally it was called the K250 and they changed the name to the K200. Due to the change they no longer give you the free coffee samples which is fine. It took them 4 months to finally get me the correct water filter kit. With this order I received a water filter but they left out the 2 free cartridges and they left out the descaling solution. As far as I'm concerned when you replace something it should be the entire kit as advertised. Also when I registered this brewer I was told I would receive another email with a coupon good for 2 boxes of coffee when you purchase 2 boxes with free shipping which they didn'tdo. The first brewer didn't have the water filter kit and it took them 4 months to get one by them sending me a second brewer replacement kit. This second one was missing the drp tray so I had to keep the original from the first brewer. The 2nd brewer also had a crack in the plastic resorvior so I had to keep the one that came with the first brewer. So then they sent me a third brwer but they were out of the black and I wasn't told that was just temporary so I had to pick another color which was hidious if you're a guy. 2 days later when I wrote the review I received a call saying they could send the black one and this one works but my opinion is whether it's a replacement or not, everything that is supposed to come with the K250(K200) should still come with it. Last of all when I registered this brewer I was told specifically by the representative I would receive a coupon good for 2 free boxes of coffee when you purchase 2 by email even though it was a replacement. This did not happen at all. If you're going to purchase a brewer by Keurig don't believe everything they tell or promise you.,3.0,1

This is the 2nd Keurig Machine that I have owned and will be the last. Not only am I beyond frustrated, I purchased the machine only to get it home and found that it had been previously purchased and used (and broke and returned the store with a used K cup still in it GROSS) I then came back home and unpacked a new machine and had problems with that one, and called Kurig customer service only to be treated rudely. This machine does not read the top of the K cups nor does the outside of the packaging indicate that you CAN'T use your old K cups with it. So folks if you don't have the right K cups - beware, you will have to go out and purchase the right ones to use with this machine. Then, hold your breath that the machine will hold the water and it won't leak all over the place. Horrible experience with this thing!!!,1.0,1

Hard to clean. There is a tray in the cleaning area that needs to be cleaned every couple of cups.......otherwise liquid stays there and you cannot get a good cup of tea, hot chocolate, apple cider after a cup of coffee......Doesn't hold enough water. Unless the K Cup has a lavender or pink ring around it it will NOT work in this machine......makes no sense. I will be returning it to the store. We also purchased one for our office and will be returning it as well. I will/have shared my dissatisfaction with my family and friends and will continue to do so. Really disappointed in Keurig. I loved my old one........Unhappy in Texas.,1.0,1
This Modern Sleep mattress is just amazing! After one night of sleeping on it my wife and I both got up in the morning without any back pain. This was not the case after sleeping on our previous mattress which cost 10X more than the Modern Sleep mattress cost. Our previous mattress was a name brand orthopedic 3 piece mattress set that was supposed to support your body so that you did not get up in the morning with aches and pains. It did not perform as good as this Modern Sleep mattress. This Modern Sleep mattress is a firm mattress so you do not sag while sleeping. The innersprings are individual coils wrapped in fabric. This advanced technology allows you to move around or roll over without disturbing your sleeping partner. The pillow top with layers of cool gel memory foam is not only individually supportive to each of your body parts it also breathes so that you will not sweat as much as you would with other types of memory foam. I had this mattress delivered to my house and I was surprised as to how it came. The Modern Sleep mattress comes compressed. It was delivered in a 14” x 15” x 5'-6” box rolled up like a piece of carpet (see video). After unboxing we took the rolled up mattress to the bedroom and set it on our existing box spring. The next step is to remove the layers of plastic wrap that is keeping it rolled and compressed. Remove the first layer of plastic wrap and unroll the mattress. Then cut the vacuum sealed bag and it blows up to full size right in front of you. The instructions say to allow the mattress to expand for up to 48 hours so it can return to its original shape. We live in Phoenix so it's hot here and the mattress was ready to sleep on in about 5 to 6 hours. One thing to note is that this Modern Sleep mattress does not come with a foundation. So throw your old mattress away and keep your existing box spring to support it. On top of everything else this mattress comes with a 10 year limited warranty (3 full years and then 7 years prorated). If you are in need of a new mattress you cannot go wrong purchasing one of these based on price and quality!,5.0,1

I recently purchased the queen size set in ivory.  The order came two days earlier than expected which was a great surprise. The packaging was very classy and when I opened the zipper to feel the sheets, I could not wait to put them on my bed. They felt like silky butter. After following the washing and drying instructions, I started placing them on my bed, which is a very thick 16 inch gel mattress and they fit very well. As I was putting the pillow cases on, I noticed that the stitching on the outer edges were bunched up and there was no way to straighten them out as the directions say no iron. I decided to email customer service about my situation and within minutes of sending the email, they responded back.  That alone was amazing to me, especially in today's world where great customer service does not seem to exist anymore.  They told me that they would be sending me out a new set of pillow cases the very next day. The following morning, I recieved an email with the tracking number and their apologizes again for the unfortunate situation.  The sheets are very soft and wrinkle free.  I am a hot sleeper and definately felt a great difference sleeping on them.  I am not exactly sure what the material is due to the fact that the label says 100% bamboo feel fiber, but never the less, they did the job of keeping me cool and comfortable all night.  These sheets are very thin, so keep in mind if you have any print on your mattress pad or pillows, it will show through with the ivory color. I don't think it would with any of the darker colors.  Other than that, I would reccomend these sheets for those who have night sweats as well as those who just want a great nights sleep.  Thank you again Okao for your superb customer service and wonderful sheet sets!

I 've had this for just over a year and I'm ready to trash it. It was wonderful at first, but the grill plates have lost their non-stick feature and they are very difficult to clean.  The unit heats up quickly, cooks evenly, and does a good job draining the grease.  However the grease tray doesn't stay in place and I can't count the times it has fallen on the floor filled with grease. That can be remedied simply by placing the  unit further back on the counter.  It's possible to buy replacement grill plates,  but with shipping and handling they cost almost as much as a new unit. Don't hesitate to buy this if you want a unit that cooks well, but be prepared for the non-stick feature to not last very long.,2.0,1

we got it a month ago, so my review isn't based on a long term use.
it took my husband and me about 2 hours to assemble - you must have two people to get it done.
it looks very elegant and nice. my in-laws spent 6 nights on it and were comfortable. also - we love sitting on it as a couch.

i'm not giving it a full 5 star rating because: 1- assembeling it wasn't easy and the instructions could have been clearer. and 2- my in-laws said that one time the bed kinda tipped over to one side. i wasn't there so i can't say what happened, but i would guess a big bed like this one shouldn't do that.

all in all - good deal. hope it'll last.,4.0,1

I bought this bed with some hesitation because I've never bought a mattress online before. I got it two weeks ago and the first night it seemed a bit hard...but after a couple of days...it began to get softer. I wanted a mattress that cuddled me like a baby and this one does. You sink into it and I love it. My hip and back pain are gone...and when I fall asleep...I don't wake up in all night. I was looking at mattresses 2 and 3 times the cost of this one and I'm glad I saved my money and got this mattress instead. This was one purchase I don't regret!,5.0,1
I had read the reviews online before purchasing this item, so i was aware that this chair did sit low. Which it definitely does. It's perfect for the bedroom. I have it in the corner near the closet. Perfect height for putting on shoes. Very easy to assemble and I really like the color. (I got the gray) Nice material too and durable!

Definitely will get a second chair when I move into a place with room for a separate office!,4.0,1
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Everything about the umbrella is top notch in my book! It looks great, it operates smoothly, and it was a very good deal at 20% off plus free shipping! I specifically ordered this model because I desired an umbrella with a manual lift as opposed to a crank system, to avoid the breakage caused by over-cranking. Also, in that same category, I did not want a tilt system for the same reason - breakage. I am hoping this model will be around for years to come!,5.0,-1

I have been needing a new mattress for quite some time as my old one was as hard as the floor. Due to a back injury, I cannot lay flat or on real firm surfaces. I was so excited to be able to choose this mattress to review. First, I will say you will need help in getting it in your house and to your room as it weighs 106 pounds. It is packaged quite well. It is compressed and rolled up which makes it easy to get in the house and in your bedroom as long as you have 2 strong people. My daughter and I had to place it on a blanket and slide it through my house because we were unable to lift it. My husband brought it inside with a hand truck. However, once we got it on the box springs, I cut the plastic off and the mattress expanded quickly to full size. Be prepared for a smell as the foam mattresses have a weird smell to them that usually goes away in a few days. They just need to air out a bit. There are "handles" on the sides of the mattress to grab for easy adjusting and moving. The mattress itself is beautiful, soft, and so very comfortable to lay on. I had to try it out right away so I laid down on it. My 16 year old daughter also laid on it and I couldn't tell she even got on the bed. You can move and not disturb the other person. The coils in this bed are encased in separate pockets so they can contour precisely to your body. Individually wrapped coil innersprings move independently and reduce the sensation of movement. The pillow top is so soft. It gives you a soft cushy feel with just the right amount of support your body needs. I was able to fit my satin sheets on this mattress perfectly. They have 15" deep pockets that are made for pillow top beds. This mattress is 14" high. My standard queen fitted sheets won't fit so keep that in mind when considering this mattress. The cool gel foam helps keep a cooler sleeping surface which is good because I always get hot at night. Overall, I am absolutely thrilled with this mattress and I recommend it to everyone who hates firm mattresses.,5.0,1
Sheets are nice and soft. The color is really pretty. The fitted sheet is nice because it fits our 12in mattress and tucks really well. Overall very satisfied!,5.0,-1

The machine will make a cup of coffee occasionally - the rest of the time the machine tells you brew interrupted and you spend the next hour trying to clean the thing out.

The product malfunctions every time I use it. The Brewer water is under too much pressure every time, and I get coffee grounds in every cup. I haven't even had the model replaced three times.

I was very disappointed once I had purchased the beautiful red Keurig I was unable to even make one cup of coffee. I made this purchase to replace my family member's Keurig which no longer works consistently or not at all. Once I got it and set it up and was ready to to make a cup of coffee I found out it will only accept Keurig brand pods. This is not acceptable because so many companies make cups that fit the original one. I returned it immediately to get my money back. Very disappointed.,2.0,1

We received our Brewer yesterday (03/25/2016) and decided to use the same day, we were very curious to see how it would work. My daughters were equally excited so we decided to make hot chocolate. My husband washed before and ran the hot water before the first brew. Everything was really easy, then just put the little cup in and then delicious hot chocolate comes out! That easy! I still want to try other flavored/ different beverages, but for now it seems like it works great and we definetely love it!,5.0,1

I use my Keurig 2.0 EVERYDAY! and always wandered when I place a store bought K-cup or even my own K-cup I only have 3 choices in ounces. It always starts with 8 oz and then I can select the other ounces which are 6 oz & 4 oz. This upsets me because I have a favorite coffee mug which is kind of big, so when I select the only big ounce size (8 oz) when I look in my cup I feel like I have to repeat step 1 again. Then I went on Keurig's website and it says for the 2.0 it has more than 3 settings?? is my Keurig 2.0 broke or something? I plan on buying the carafe but sometimes I just want one big cup of coffee. Can somebody from the Keurig Corp. tell me why I only have 3 different ounce settings? maybe something needs to be replaced? Thank You!,4.0,1

I do like the slim design and the choice of colors. However, I am extremely disappointed that the system advertised 9 brew sizes but in fact only brews 4-,6-, 8- or 10 oz. sizes. I have 14 oz travel mugs and I have to brew 2 times to get a full mug. My coffee mugs are all large and again I have to brew 2 times to get a full mug of coffee or 3 times to get a full mug for tea as the hot water only brews 4 or 6 oz sizes. Who drinks only 4 or 6 oz of tea??? I also do not like the fact that I cannot use a reusable pod. I miss my custom blends of the seasons and my freshly ground beans. I wish I never spent the money on this. I am going to resurrect my old one - I haven't tossed it yet - and it still brewed better than this model. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED KEURIG! It's not even worth shipping back to you.,1.0,1
The bed is really pretty and fairly easy to put together, as others have said. My only gripe is the tacks along the edges are not real upholstery tacks, but a somewhat cheap-looking chain of fake tack heads. Every fifth fake tack has a real tack under it, which makes it stick out farther than the others, so in addition to looking fake, it is also uneven. You can't see it from across the room though, and the rest of the bed is quite nice.,4.0,-1
Very soft! I don't care for microfiber, but this is a great exception. It fits a tall mattress well, and was the exact color I was wanting to match my comforter, and it's been through the wash dozens of times with no fade. Dog and cat claws have yet to cause harm to it as well. So glad I went against my "no microfiber" rule for these sheets!,5.0,1
I have owned (and still own) several different Keurig brewers. I bought the K250 for a holiday home I was visiting. It was perfect for making our morning coffee and I didn't miss the larger reservoir or the extra features of the higher level brewers at all. If you kitchen counter space is limited, this might be better for you than the larger and mor full featured brewers and the mini plus (which has no reservoir),5.0,1

I replaced my older smile serve Kerrigan with this newer model. I wish now I had kept the older one. This does not fill the cup anywhere near what it says. I cannot use the many pics I already had,thus money gone.am disappointed there is no shut off,stays on at all times,and is very warm by day's end.(Have taken to unplugging). Having thrown the box it came in away,and info(dumb,but really thought would be as good as previous model) am stuck with it. Over all,while the color is very nice,is not what I had hoped for. More than likely will put this away,and go for another coffe maker.,3.0,1

Bought this set for my bathroom thinking that I could use one in the bathroom and one in the Kitchen as the decor is similar. The smaller rug fits perfectly in front of my tub and extends out in front of the sink as well (nailed it!). The larger rug was much larger than I thought it was going to be and makes an amazing rug to stand on while doing dishes. The colors are not quite the same as the picture the darker browns are all about right, but the "stones" that appear to be very light tan (or even a little gray) are actually a very pale sage green color. It wasn't a problem for my particular rooms, but may be for someone whom has no green at all in their rooms.  

****On a side note,  my female cat is oddly attracted to the larger rug. She has never paid any attention to any of my rugs, and the smaller rug in the bathroom in no exception. The larger rug however she will not leave it alone, rolling all over it and its crumpled up in the middle of the kitchen floor every morning. Not sure what is causing that but she doesn't seem to harm the rug at all (not urinating on it or scratching it up. There isn't any kind of smell that I as a human can pick up.,5.0,1

Every 8x10 rug seemed to be hundreds of dollars. I really only needed a rug for my dogs to play on. I figured if they had accidents on it, it wouldn't hurt as much as if I bought a really expensive rug and had to throw it out. They seem to like it even though it's not that soft.,4.0,1

I needed a small bench for my front door walkway area, and this fit the bill. It is sturdy but not too heavy to move around easily; the seat has a good "spring" construction for strength and comfort; and the all weather wicker is great for outdoors. I put it together easily in about 15 minutes--needed only the acorn nuts and the little wrench which was provided. Very pleased with this purchase and the price for it on Hayneedle!,4.0,1
I never used to be a fan of Keurig in fact I thought they were stupid, when I drink coffee I drink a few cups at a sitting so the thought of a machine that specialized at making one cup at a time seemed ridiculous to me.  Then some friends were going on a trip and asked my wife and I if we could stay at their house and watch their dogs while they were gone. These friends had a Keurig and a bunch of different coffee and said we could help ourselves to whatever we wanted.  So over the next week I got used to the Keurig and the quality of coffee it made; I got so used to it in fact that the week after our friends came back from their trip I bought my Keurig. My attitude toward Keurig has completely changed I love it, with a good coffee like Starbucks or Caribou you can make coffee shop grade coffee at home something my old machine couldn't do.  I used a French press for a while too, that made good quality coffee but it took so long to heat the water and clean it out when you were done. The Keurig is fast and easy to use makes great coffee every time.  The only thing I wish Keurig would do is make reusable mug and Carafe pods for when you want more than a standard sized cup or a few cups,  the selection of mug and carafe pods that are available sucks.,5.0,1
We purchased the 8x10, and two runners in the ivory.  Being that we have two miniature schnauzers, we did not want to put a lot of money into rugs. They are very well made and have a nice pile height. There is a bit of a dust like substance on the backing of the larger one, but I didn't find it to be a problem, as we will not be moving a rug that size very often. The two runners are rubber backed and stay in place well.  They are very plush and soft to walk on.  Really, you can't beat the price and the FREE Shipping. Will probably be purchasing others for the additional rooms we have with hardwood floors!,5.0,1

As I said, I bought 2 and was nervous about the fit because one is a regular size recliner and the other is a mac daddy that you can sleep in comfortably. It fit the smaller one with material to spare that is easily tucked in to make it look custom fit, and looks like the recliner was made in the material, which is very soft and stretchy. The extra large recliner fits great everywhere except the back of the recliner where you can see about 2 inches on each side at the very bottom of the old material. Good thing the back is facing a wall..;) overall for the price I have 2 new looking recliners that really look good. Neither of my recliners were old, but they both are in the entertainment room where my daughter and her friends hang out on the xbox, laptops, etc, and they just looked scurvy, no matter how much spot cleaning you do. Also, the smaller recliner is leather but both were easy to fit, are snug and look great. (with the exception of the huge recliner with a little material showing in the back.) This product also ships from a company called Wayfair, but I received it 3 days after ordering it shipped to my home. They sent a tracking number and have a nice website selling anything for the home. I wasn't aware of this company but will have no problem ordering from them in the future. Thanks, Walmart! :),5.0,1

I love this coffee maker. I don't know why I waited so long to purchase one. Being the only coffee drinker in my house, I love that I can make a fresh cup of coffee anytime. I've always used old style Mr. Coffee maker but this is great and so convenient. I did purchase the My K Cup reusable coffee filter and I love it. I had purchased Dunkin Donut vanilla flavor and tried several ways of making it (different size cup and used the strong method) but I did not like at all. I have not tried other brands of K-cups (Starbucks, etc) but I am happy for now just using the reusable filter. I like a darker richer coffee, much like you get from using a coffee press and when I use the reusable filter, to me, it turns out similar. Very happy with my purchase!,5.0,1

The full-size bed sheet set (taupe) are nice-looking.  I did not launder them first.  The color is about what I expected from the picture, perhaps slightly darker.  I've only had these sheets a short period of time, will need to review them at a later time, after several washings.  They are a little thinner than I expected, but the proof of their quality will be how well they last over time.  So far, so good...,4.0,-1

This set is exactly what I needed to bring the edge back to my decades old Henckels. I needed larger sharpening stones for my kitchen knives, versus the smaller stones I use for my pocket knives, and this set doesn't dissapoint.  I purchased the 10,000 grit stone as well (highly recommended), and the results are exactly as expected...a straight, razor sharp, mirror finished edge (need to 10,000 to get the best mirror finish).  The included DVD is helpful regarding the use of these particular stones, which are synthetic. I especially like the sink bridge idea, and quickly found that I throughly enjoy the convenience.  I actually leave the water on a very, very low trickle while sharpening and work the stone and knife while quickly clearing the stone of particulates. The trick is keeping a consistent angle over the entire edge, but practice make perfect, and as the video recommends, "incorporate blade touchup as part of your daily cleanup."  Needless to say, you can't go wrong with this set.  Well worth the money.,5.0,1

Pulley system...opened the umbrella before placing it in the stand to test it.. FYI... this is a two person job as I almost crushed two fingers pushing in the lock button.

I purchased 2 of the 8x10 rugs for my living room. After having the gold/cream for a few years (and loving it), I was nervous about going with a darker color. These showed up in a rich dark brown and really looks nice with my green/gold living room colors. I also bought a dark brown runner for my upstairs and 2 gray runners and 1 gray 5x7 rug for my bedroom. The gray rugs seem to be slightly softer but I'm very pleased (just like I was with the gold/cream rug years ago) with these purchases. Most of the new carpet smell is out of it but there was a strong smell when first opened. They hold up against the vacuum very well. They are very soft and great for bare feet. Both the gold/cream and dark brown don't show dirt or anything on the floor which is really nice. For the price, I would buy again in a heartbeat!,5.0,1

I use my Keurig every morning to make coffee quickly and quietly and throughout the day to make hot tea and hot cocoa. It brews fast and is relatively quiet. As a first time Keurig user, it is very easy to operate. The "power off" button on the touchscreen took a while to figure out because, the instructions don't tell you that you have to press and hold the button for it to actually turn off. Other than that this Keurig is amazing. Thank you Keurig for making such a creat machine.,5.0,1

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought the white cabinet, which has a light wood countertop and top piece. First off, I've bought cheap cabinets before and have gotten way better quality for less. The lamination is so thin (can't get wet or this thing will ripple and warp) and poorly done that I had to take a white paint pen to all the seams just so I don't look at it in complete disgust. Several pieces were badly scratched (the back panel was completely scratched up near the cord holes) which I also used the paint pen on. The handles were a gold/bronze color even though they appear to be silver in the image.. I spray painted them silver after this picture was taken. Took me about 8 hours to put together because several holes were not drilled for (all the hinges on all cabinet doors weren't predrilled for the screws that 16 missing holes just for the hinges!!) and I didn't have a drill. Another hour at least with the paint pen. After 8 hours and then seeing it together I wanted to cry bc I hated what I saw and I sure wasn't taking it apart to send it back. The paint pen and spray painting the handles made this livable but I do not recommend this purchase.,2.0,1

I never got a chance to take the lamp home with me because when I picked up my ship-to-store purchase, it was broken. The reason I ordered the lamp from the website was because when I was looking at the lamps at the WalMart store closest to me, every single lamp of the one style that I liked on the shelf was broken. So I ordered one from the website hoping WalMart would take some care shipping that one single item. I was wrong. As soon as the associate pulled it out of the bag, I could see the lamp was broken on the top from shipping at the same place that all of the other lamps that I had seen were broken.,1.0,1

As they were already assembled, nothing much was left for me to do except remove the wrappings and enjoy! The chairs are very stable, comfortable and very light to lift up. This is the cheapest price I was able to locate for these chairs, other dealers were asking for double the price I paid here.

I've owned A Keurig coffee maker for several years now. I decided to buy the K200 and found out Keurig has now added a sensor that will only allow it to use the Keurig brand k-cups. I refuse to let a coffee maker tell me what kind of coffee I have to buy since I don't always use their brand. I returned the coffee maker. Keurig will tell you it's done to give you the best brew. I think it's just to force you to buy their product. Keurig needs to rethink this latest "innovation". Guess I'll buy a Mr Coffee brand next that accepts the k-cups.,2.0,1

My boyfriend and I bought this brewer about 2 days ago and we have been going through heck to get the pods for it. Everywhere we go, no one has them. Even the pods that were included weren't compatible. It says here that the brewer works with K-Pods, K-Mug, and K-Carafe. It works with none of these! I went on the suggested website (keurig.com/oops) and watched a video that said the brewer only works with Keurig 2.0 pods, and we could find these NOWHERE. We even went on the website to try to order some, but we see nothing that's compatible. We ended up buying an OFFICIAL Keurig 2.0 do-it-yourself kind of K-cup, and tried using that. Same error message. We are BEYOND frustrated. I can't believe the experience we've had in only two days.,1.0,1

This is a product in which I enjoyed for nearly a full month. Then, it became a nightmare. My machine started getting clogged every week forcing me to get q-tips and spend 15 minutes working to fix the problem. I do not know if this is a problem others are having but I find it extremely inconvenient that I have to put so much work into something that cost me over $100. I will be returning this item and buying a different model hoping that I do not encounter the same situation or Keurig will have lost a life long customer.,2.0,1

Great sheets, soft and comfortable. Not as big as they show in the pic from the underneath of the mattress but still big enough. I have an 18" mattress and it pulls about 3"-4" extra under the mattress, but I've noticed it holds good and doesn't come untucked.,5.0,1
Would you say this model can or absolutely cannot be placed in an open shelf above the counter/in a part of the cabinet but with no door, and if it can, what would the minimum recommended dimensions be of that "cubby" I don't want a huge microwave but also would like to free up the counterspace.  Thank you!,5.0,-1

This is a so so machete. The CRKT machete is MUCH better and priced roughly the same. What I could do with 3 chops with the CRKT, took me 12 with the Gerber. The grip on the CRKT is much better as well.

The Gerber felt like I was chopping at small saplings, not slicing through them. The CRKT would just slice effortlessly through all sorts of types of vegetation.

I just received my planters. I was expecting a matched pair, but they arrived nested. Reviewing the website, I saw that only the larger dimensions are listed the product description, and in large font on the specifications tab. In smaller print the second, smaller planter is listed. Also, I was not expecting open slats on the bottoms and black plastic liner bags. They look solid. All in all, they are pretty, but they can't flank the door as I wanted, because they are mismatched. Yes, I could have seen this from the photo, but I thought it was a perspective thing, not a size thing.,3.0,1

I ordered the color "spa", the lightest ones, color is spot on to the pic on the listing. As far as sizing, look at the numbers listed not the picture. Nice, thick, plush rugs. 
One thing: if you have any sort of balance issue, foot sensitivity or have trouble on uneven surfaces these are NOT for you. The pebbles are soft but the rug is uneven all over.  That being said, these are nice rugs at a great price.,5.0,1
Paid $200 and opened the box and all of the hardware was just thrown into the box loose so it scratched all the pieces. There were multiple pieces that were missing chunks out of them or corners were smashed from being dropped during either packaging or shipping and there was nothing in between the pieces in the box to protect them. For the price you would think there would be more quality and care and that it would at least have metal legs not plastic and actual glass doors not plastic since it does say glass doors on the label. I will not be buying another item through this company nor will I recommend them to anyone I know or talk too.,1.0,1

First let me start by saying I have slept on the same Sealy Posturepedic bed for a very long time and was looking at new mattresses and had already bought a bed platform when I got the chance to try this out. I also want to state that I have never slept on a memory foam bed even though they have been around for a very long time. I feel this information is important if you are in the market so you can base your opinion off my comments knowing the history. That being said I was surprised that the box arrived and was a cylinder shape but weighing 106 pounds according to the FedEx shipping weight. I would recommend that you have someone help you set it up due to the awkward shape of a mattress and the give it has along with the fact it weighs 106 pounds. I'm stubborn and did it alone but it was a real bear to maneuver it onto the new platform I had. When I opened the box the mattress was cylindrical in shape and a very tight fit so it was hard to get out of the box so I used the scissors that came with my kitchen knives and very carefully cut along an edge to free it. I have shown in stages the removal and setup in the accompanying video I made as well. When you unseal the vacuum wrapped plastic sheeting which is thick, tightly wound and there are a few layers the bed literally seems to self inflate in an instant so be ready and have it on or in the position you require. Mine inflated upside down which was pretty awful seeing I was doing it solo. When they say 14" they may actually be understating it because some sheets might not be deep enough for this mattress. It is that plush and that deep. When you sit on the edge of the bed the foam immediately gives way and has no rim or edge to keep in structured so I had to get used to the feeling it was pitching me off the edge of the bed and have since learned to sit further back on the edge initially. I also noticed the first night that an average adult when laying in the same position for awhile will eventually sink into the point of feeling the firmness of the springs beneath the foam layers. I was not sure about whether it would be comfortable after a nights sleep so I waited a few nights to write the review. I have always preferred a pillowtop but with some support but figured once I was used to the memory foam this would fit the bill and it does. I find that getting comfortable is much easier and I'm falling asleep faster when I do lay down at night. That is saying a lot because I have a couple of work related injuries on my back from years ago. If I don't have the right balance of soft and support I am like the Tin Man from Oz minus the oil can in the morning and after a week I have had no issues with pain in the morning, I'm falling asleep faster and the foam literally cradles me as it conforms to me when I am first going to bed. If you are like me and have back injuries I would recommend it and if you don't then you'll find it even better to sleep on. I have to say I am amazed because I was looking at Sealy mattresses at twice the price and this is insanely comfortable. Enough so that I ws also looking to replace a mattress on a bed in a spare room and intend to spend half the amount on one of these in that room. It's a great, comfy and economical bed.,4.0,1

I love my new cabinet!  As mentioned in the reviews it was very easy to assemble.  It is the perfect size, not too big and not too small.  It holds quite a bit of  kitchen things and by putting things in the drawers and on the shelves, it provided more counter top space which was my ultimate goal.  It is also sturdy enough - I put my microwave on top and it holds it fine!,5.0,1

Very disappointed in the Kuerig 2.0. This is the second one I have bought in 6 months. The first one would not brew a cup of coffee after inserting the pod. Brought it back and continued to use an older Kuerig model ( which I have loved for the pas 8 yrs)which no longer drips water. I bought a second Kuerig and it has an awful plastic taste that will not go away. I have read many reviews and find this is quite common with the 2.0. I also find the 2.0 version very cheaply made compared to the older models. Very disappointed and sad to say I will no longer be a Kuerig user. Making coffee shouldn't be this much of a hassle.,1.0,1

I recently purchased this brewer to replace my Mini Keurig and VUE Brewers. The size is great (like the mini( it fits perfectly on my counter.

Outfitting a new bedroom set we wanted something very nice, but not "to bright." This 3-pc set in dark gray has a pleasant design and allowed us to get a print curtain for the room. If we want to add more color, a couple of throw pillows will do fine. The quilt and pillow covers are thin (therefore light weight)  yet appear to be sturdy. Also, many reviewers of coverlets said that often they're very large and drag on floor. This coverlet is perfect for our bed and makes a beautiful addition to the room.,5.0,1

I waited to write a review until I had my Keurig for several weeks to compare performance against the many reviews that already existed (especially the negative ones). Pros: First, the system is everything I needed in general for brewing a single serve cup of coffee - nice and hot, plenty strong. I enjoy the flexibility of different flavors with every cup. It is easy to use, actually stores on my counter under the wall cupboards with enough space to lift the lid to place in the cups. Having a variety pack of the regular coffee and teas has been wonderful for guests who all have differences in opinion for which coffee/tea to have, and although more expensive than knock off brands, not out of line for single serve coffee preps (especially when ordering in more of bulk size number of cups). Since I am one who orders gourmet beans for flavored coffees using an online service, I am anticipating the release of the My KCup for this model. Cons: Most of the things I didn't like are not deal breakers, but more wish list vs. general functionality. A better staying and easier to replace water reservoir lid (easy to misalign and fall into reservoir), drip tray not attached to unit is too easy to move. One too many screens for access for dispensing water. Too long a time until auto shutoff of the unit (for my type of usage, which is typically morning and evening only - not all day use). Comments vs. other negative reviews: 1) I did not need a "to go" carafe cup size and did not order this product expecting it to do so as the specs for brewing were provided. 2) After washing my carafe before use, I did not experience the "smell" that others have. 3) I have never experienced grounds coming through the system. 4) I have not experienced any program or power issues with this unit as were described in other reviews - and the water dispensed is hot enough to burn! Suggestions to Keurig: A larger reservoir would be nice, but as a single cup user this could lead to microbial issues. 2) Programmable for specific user preferences would be nice since there is more than one user in our household. Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review!,4.0,1

Our first night on the Modern Sleep mattress was one of the best nights rest we have had in ages. We didn't find that there were any pressure points while lying or sleeping and both of us woke with no back or neck pain, and with the individually wrapped innerspring coils we didn't disturb one another by moving during the night. Dare I say it is like sleeping on a cloud!
This isn't our first mattress from Walmart.com that came compressed in a box. Our first was a Slumber 1 - 10" Tight Top Extra Firm mattress that has been superb in comfort and quality but sadly is no longer available, however, our new Modern Sleep Pillow Top 14" Hybrid mattress is by far superior to the Slumber 1.
First off the Modern Sleep mattress is a pillow top that is filled with gel-infused memory foam that gives you a cooler nights sleep than traditional memory foam as well as a layer of comfort foam for a total of 1 3/4" pillow top layer. Under the pillow top there is another 1" layer of gel-infused memory foam followed by another 3 layers of comfort foam for a total of an additional 3 3/4" of memory foam support. Under all this you have 8" individually wrapped innerspring coils that really give you great support. The outer top cover is so soft feeling and one of the great features this mattress has is that each side has sewn in handles for easy moving if needed. This is not a mattress that you can or should flip over, only turn from head to foot and back if needed.
The mattress itself comes boxed and is approximately 5 1/2 feet long and 12" x 12" square and weighs a little over 100 pounds. Unboxing was not a problem and setting it up was a breeze (see video) but best done with 2 people.
Please don't be turned off by a mattress that is compressed or shipped in a box. It is amazing how quickly they do expand and the quality of this mattress. It also comes with a 10 year warranty so how can you go wrong.
We did NOT notice any "odd" odor from the mattress we received but I do know some memory foams can give off a certain smell for a while. Please take note that Modern Sleep advises that you wait 48 to 72 hours before sleeping on the mattress for it to fully expand. Our first mattress, the Slumber 1, we slept on the first night and have had no problems however with the Modern Sleep we waited 72 hours before using it.,5.0,1

Well, I messed up, but that's alright with me. This A&P Collection White Floral Leaf Twin Duvet Cover is absolutely beautiful on my twin bed. Apparently I'm not too savvy about bedding and decor as I did not realize what a duvet was. I needed a nice covering for my twin bed, saw this, loved it, and ordered it. When I received it I realized it's an actual cover that unzips to put a blanket (or duvet) inside to keep it protected. I felt silly not knowing that, but realized I can still use it as it's intended purpose. I have a quilt my grandmother made that fits perfectly inside the cover. The quilt had some fabrics used on it that are a little course and don't feel wonderful against the skin, but with the soft duvet cover it is now very comfortable to snuggle up with. There are also some places where the quilt is separating at the seams a little so this will protect it from getting rubbed and pulled, plus the cover will keep it nice and clean. I wash everything before I use it so when the cover arrived it went immediately into the washing machine and then dryer. It washed up so nicely. I'm glad I messed up, learned something new, have a covering to protect my grandma's quilt, and now have a beautiful addition to my bedroom.,5.0,1

I love the fact that my comforter set was inside a vacuum sealed bag when I took it out of the box!  So I believe that protected the stitching and the overall set.  It looks great on my bed especially after I purchased 2 king sized pillows to put inside the shams.  Firm pillows work the best.  I have a queen sized bed, so I purchased the king sized set and it lays on my bed very nicely all the way down the sides like I wanted.  I kept my previous bed skirt on the bed just because its a hassle to remove.  The downside was the color.  The description said rust orange, but the picture looked more orange, so I went with that because I was hoping it was more orange, but the color is really more rust.  Although, when I open my blinds, the natural light does make it look more orange so I can deal with that.  It did have quite a few wrinkles, but I can get those out.  I did NOT wash it like most people do when they get a new comforter set.  Washing will mess it up!  Leave it alone.  You should not sleep on top of the comforter anyway.  Overall, I really like this set and I would recommend it to anyone.,4.0,-1

It is so cute but when I went to put it in the ground up at our trailer it was very loose where it screws together. I think it's stripped. So I just stuck the top half in the ground & it's way to short that way. When I go back to the trailer I'm going to take some Gorilla glue  to see if that will hold.  Unless you have any suggestions on how to fix it. I didn't keep my packing receipt for it or else I would return it for an exchange.,2.0,1

I bought the 2.0 in Jan 2016 and it only worked 1 month without problems. Since then I have gone through all of the processes that are suggested in the manual and on the website, three times. I will not work for 2-3 days and then just start working again. I have used a Keurig brewer for several years, at home and work, but wish I had not bought the 2.0.,1.0,1

it says 1800 Series but they are so thin.  I would not buy a third party seller. because you will not be able to return them to the store, This is a lesson learned. I have to pay for the shipping of these heavy sheets. No I am not buying this kind again.,3.0,1
I bought this rug for my kids' bathroom and have been pleasantly surprised by its quality. I have been able to vacuum the rug quite easily. The length is the perfect size for my kids' bathroom space, providing coverage in front of the sink, the toilet and the tub. I'm going to purchase two for my own bathroom which is much larger with a roman tub and double sinks. Great find.,5.0,1
The fit was perfect. Doesn't slide around, is large enough to tuck in sides and long enough in the front and back. I don't have any negative comments and look forward to washing when needed as the material seems durable. Considering getting one for my couch next.,5.0,1

I was so happy to be able to order these blinds for my narrow windows with out special ordering. The first set went up well but the 2nd set drooped. I tried to re-adjust the placement of the bracket to see if that would help and the bottom support of the bracket snapped off. Now I have no privacy between my front window and the street.,2.0,-1
The headboard is heavy, sturdy, and the fabric is thick and well made. It was fairly easy to put together, although we had to re-drill the holes for our bed frame, as they didn't line up. My only complaint was that, as others have stated, only about every fifth or sixth upholstery tack is a real one. Otherwise, it's a strip of faux tacks. From across the room, it isn't noticeable, but up close, the real tacks stick up further than the faux ones. Not a deal breaker -- I read that going in, but just note that you WILL be able to notice it.,4.0,-1

First off, colors are definitely not as vibrant as shown, which is what I was going for so that was disappointing. Would have delt with it, but the full size doesnt even fit my full mattress that well. Extra fabric and very baggy looking. It is soft, so theres that, although, not good for hot sleepers. Im returning for a refund so I can get actual bright colored sheets.,2.0,-1

This mat is pretty awesome. The size is nice and big but not too big. It feels nice and thick and seem slike it will hold up well. The letter is so nice looking.  I would have given it a 5 star rating if the letter was attached to the mat.  Its a round disk that can lift out of the center and moves around a big. I understand that it was made this way to be able to customize it, but now I have to figure out what will glue it down and make sure I get it center and make sure it will hold up to the elements. Other than that I really love it and would buy it again.,4.0,-1

I had been looking for a shag rug for a while, I've bought a couple other area rugs but they have that indoor/outdoor carpet feel and look flat so I wanted something nicer. I wanted the shag rug style but they are so expensive.. I seen this rug and bought it in the 5x8 size, rich brown color and it has been great. The quality is great, I have laminate wood floor and it stays place pretty well, occasionally I have to readjust it but not too often. It is also one of the most affordable rugs in this style that I have found. I do vacuum mine frequently, this not only keeps it clean but it makes the shag look great too. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a shag style rug at an affordable price.,5.0,1

I just got mine today and I'm very impressed. I get skeptical with online shopping for bedding sets because the pictures can be misleading, but this was a very nice bedding set at a very reasonable price considering it comes with all the sheets.
My only small problem is that the comforter is just a little too thin, but other than it's great.
I bought mine for 39.98. Im just a little upset because the price went down to $31 two days after I bought it.,5.0,1
They are nice shades. I bought them for my bedroom but they are kind of plasticky so they look more for like an office space. I had bought shades from Chicology before and they were pretty.  This are very dark in color (yet not blackout at night), when set to filter light they still make the room pretty dark and I don't like that for my bedroom during the day. So, the only way to get light in the room is to open them all the way up, but that defeats the purpose of having some privacy. I would not recommend for a bedroom or living space, maybe for an office space.,3.0,-1

East to use.  Lightweight.  Fills up and then the water retracts the hose.  Easy to store.  Great nozzle.  So far no leaks   Only issue is when you try and put this hose onto another vessel such as a Miracle Grow nozzle that has fertilizer in it, it doesn't fit it tightly.  There is a lot of leaks.  But if you use this on its own with its own nozzle it is fine.,4.0,1

This is my second Keurig 2.0. First one was a gift. It didn't read any of the pods so Keurig was very good about replacing it. The new one still has problems reading the pods. It reads some of the one in the box and not others. Frustrating. I don't like that it doesn't turn off. I unplug it, again very frustrating. I think whatever part is suppose to read the pods needs a lot of upgrading.,2.0,1
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Nice quality, fits perfect over my 3 x 6 dining table. Color is a bit brighter than I expected, but blends with the rest of our patio accessories.

I am very fussy about my sheets. They have to be 100% cotton and feel comfortable, smooth, not scratchy and last a decent period of time. These seemed to be similar to the Select Edition sheets that I can no longer find at Walmart, so I took a chance and bought them. It took 3 washings to get the softness that I like, but now they are perfect. Tip: don't let them sit in the dryer too long as they will wrinkle, but the wrinkles can be smoothed out on the bed. Totally recommend!,5.0,1
The sheets look nice however there is no way they are 600 thread count, higher thread count means thicker and softer sheets, these are maybe at best 300 thread count. I order another set of sheets of a different brand that are 650 thread count and there is a HUGE difference.,2.0,1
This is THE waffle maker that you will veer need to make perfect waffles all the time, every time! The machine is portable and lightweight, so you can take it wherever you go and have the ability to make fresh waffles. The waffle maker is easy to use and the control know is easy to use to make or to customize the cook of your waffle. The waffles comes out cooked uniformly and a perfect golden brown. The waffles made using this maker are perfectly crispy and the patterns are the best. The liquid does not spill out from this waffle maker and it cooks waffles in a short amount of time, so having waffles can be very convenient. I used this to make breakfast daily and it's also good to be pancakes and egg omelettes too. There's no excuse not to have breakfast without waffles and this is great for that. I recommend this waffle maker!,5.0,-1
I like the GE Microwave very much. I only use it heat TV dinners, to heat tea or coffee, or to heat some other food item such as some small pies that a neighbor brought to  me the other day.

I like that this hose fits into my watering can for storage between uses.  Some problems, though: wouldn't connect to an old faucet on the property, so I had to buy an adapter... hose leaked from both ends from day one... it sprung a leak at about the 25' point and is now totally unuseable.  I plan to buy this kind of hose again, but will spend the extra money for a brand name product with brass fittings instead of plastic.,3.0,1
I ordered a maroon rug... and was given a BLACK rug when I went to pick it up. I just moved and didnt have time to wait for the CORRECT item to be delivered so I had to make due.

This little hose looked really cute on the website. It was delivered quickly and looked nice attached to my faucet.  Then I used it--within abut 8 minutes of use, the hose came apart.  I thought perhaps it was one of the pop off ends that connects the hose. It was not-the actual fabric covered hose had pulled away from the connective end. It was useless. Until I replace it, I guess I will be carrying water for my flowers.  DEFINITELY not a good choice!,1.0,1
I like these curtains alot,I have been redecorating my bedroom with a plaid blue theme.They add to the decor well and fit my huge windows.It ended up being a little more expensive than I was expecting tho.On the package it shows the entire set up making one think thats all in the package....the two panels and valance.It doesn't.One panel or one valance is all you get.You have to order all three pieces if you want to do the whole window properly.Ended up being about 50 bucks per window.,5.0,1

Iâm so disappointed with this purchase- the header discription for this product states âDurable Outdoor Cushionâ and naturally you would think it would be somewhat water repellant BUT it isnât! Why would it be considered durable if it canât even repel water. Now my old outdoor cushion is inside this cover soaking wet and not drying out because of the âdurable coverâ! I highly recommend that âOutdoorâ be taken off the header for this cushion cover because it does NOT need to be used outdoors! I would not recommend this item for an outdoor cushion and wish I would have never wasted my money on it!,1.0,1

I bought this keurig thinking it was new and wanted to replace an old one. Coffee comes out luke warm and never is hot. In order for me to get a hot cup of coffee I need to put it in the microwave after the Keurig finishes pouring. There is no setting as in older models to change the temperature so I am left microwaving constantly. Absolutely the worst temperature I have ever had a cup of coffee. If I was the only one I would think it's me but the 3 people in my family all agree. For a new machine not to have a setting to increase temperature is ridiculous. Called Keurig and they didn't do anything. At first I was disgusted about all the kcups I had that I couldn't use if that wasn't enough my coffee needs to be nuked in order to drink it.,2.0,1

Purchased these shag rugs online; one in the 5'x8' and two 3'4"x5'. We ordered all three rugs in rich plum, which is more of a burgundy. Its a rich, dark color which is exactly what we wanted. The shag pile is very soft to walk on, not coarse like some shags can be. Our order arrived within three days from the date of purchase (actually a day earlier than estimated). Because of the binding from shipping, when we unrolled the large 5x7, the pile in some areas was very flat. I took a broom and swept in across the flatten areas and viola, plush pile. I always steam clean our rugs when first purchased and these cleaned very easily. I noticed no odor, snags, discolorations, etc. that can sometimes plague a new rug purchased online. For the price, these were a steal. Couldn't be happier with this purchase.,5.0,1
These are certainly NOT JUST FOR CHURCHES AND OFFICES - a very good looking sturdy and comfortable chair to put around a big table in our finished basement for games etc. -- bought six and am very happy! No more gluing wooden chairs and pads -- these are indestructible and the padding is built in. Some people say the seat is hard - disagree completely -- it's firm in a comfortable way and the chair feels really good for sitting a long time - don't hesitate to buy. Also - very pleased with the great price - can't be beat! I'd give them more than five stars if I could.,5.0,1
I was so disappointed in these. For the price and 600 thread count, I expected nice luxurious sheets. They are rough and coarse. I washed them 4 times in hot water with fabric softener and they have improved slightly but definitely NOT worth the money.,1.0,1
I have an older Keurig but thought I would give this one a try. I do like how it was smaller but when I want to have hot water for my tea the highest oz that I can have is 6oz. I personally like 8oz. Also I do not like that I can not use any kcup/reusable cup. I try to be environmentally conscious and using a kcup every day is not. I would recommend just using a french press. You will get much better coffer for a lot cheaper.,3.0,1

Bought the 400 thread count and loved them so thought the 600 would be even better.  You wouldn't think they were made by the same manufacturer.  Washed the sheets first of course and noticed right away how wrinkly they were.  They looked awful but i didn't care.  But when sleeping on them, could not sleep at all because they were so uncomfortable, they were very stiff, very scratchy, and extremely noisy.  Don't know how the other reviews found them soft unless they had different manufacturers.  I am taking the wrinkly, scratchy things back!  BTW  they were also very hot, could not sleep with the comforter with the sheets.  VERY DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS BUY!  Would not recommend to anyone who wants soft sheets.,1.0,1

I have searched for over six months for bar stools between 24"-26" in height that matched my kitchen with no luck. I had settled on some swivel stools but luckily my order was cancelled by walmart due to them being on backorder which was when I "settled" for these. I wanted something that didn't stick out from under my island, stools that were padded for comfort, and stools that offered a pretty good size seat for larger people. The leather is a deeper brown than pictured (which was great for me). They were not complicated to put together. I ordered three and NONE arrived damaged and was well packaged. And they seem extremely sturdy!,5.0,1
Max cup size with a kcup is 10oz which only fills maybe half of my cup. My old Keurig that just broke would fill the cup. Water resovior is way to small.

I am a Spark Reviewer for Walmart and was sent a free King sized set of Hotel Style 600 thread count 100% Egyptian Cotton sheets with a Sateen Weave. The set includes 1 flat sheet, 1 fitted sheet and 2 king pillowcases. The set is what I call QUALITY. The sheets are not flimsy like so many are today. The material is woven so you can barely see you hand through them and they have a soft feel to them, but not silky. The flat sheet and pillowcases have a beautiful sateen weave about 4” from the top edge that runs on both sides of the material. It is very soft and pretty. The top sheet is one of the first that I have ever seen that actually is sized for a king sized mattress. I was very surprised when I put the sheets on the bed as to how they fit. I’ll start by saying that I have a 15” thick mattress which puts me about in the middle of mattress thicknesses. The flat top sheet actually hangs off the sides 16” on each side and 18” on the end. This made for easy tucking in on the end of the bed and wonderful sleeping where my husband and I weren’t struggling to have the sheet on both of us at the same time. This means you actually get to cover up with the sheet. The fitted sheet is the best constructed fitted sheet I have ever seen. I also had a lot of room to spare and tuck under, so I know that it will live up to its claims of fitting up to a 20” deep mattress. The corners are deep, and what I really like about it is that it has vertical stretchy elastic so it fit my mattress size securely, but it also has plenty of room for a thicker mattress. The elastic running around the bottom of the fitted sheet is over 1” wide and sewn in very securely. I have never seen a fitted sheet with such wide elastic running around it. There is no struggling to get this sheet on and it tucked under the mattress and held securely through the night. I love the 100% Egyptian cotton because it has that crisper, fresh feeling when you sleep on it. The sheets are not scratchy, they just feel nice, and the best part is cotton breaths which makes them healthier for you to sleep on. I love getting into a cool feeling bed and then snuggling in to warm it up and that’s what the Egyptian cotton sheets allow. One of the things I also really like is when you change positions on the bed or flip your pillow, you get that cooler feeling. I always wash things before use, it’s just a thing that I like to do, so I did wash them before using them. They wash beautifully, and did not shrink. The pretty sateen stitching did not unravel, the elastic edging and corners kept their shapes, and there was very minimal wrinkling. I am not a fan of having to iron sheets and the sheets came out of the dryer with very few wrinkles, so I was more than happy to put them straight from the dryer onto the bed. I chose the white colored sheets just because I like white sheets and the white is such a nice bright white, and easily goes with any decor. I apologize for writing such a long review, but these sheets are truly the best I have ever had. The stars only let me choose up to 5 stars, but really these are a 10.,5.0,1
This is a nice carpet for the price. We wanted something not so pricey but something that would look good. My kids love the feel of the carpet on their bare feet. I just wish it would have come in a charcoal grey color instead of brown, but it still looks good in our living room.,5.0,1

The encased 8" thick mattress is comfortable however the futon frame is much too frail & unstable to support the mattress.  Mattress tends to bunch up in the center & the frame is extremely difficult to layout into bed form. Took a professional 1 -2 hrs to assemble, amd had to spend more money of course I had a futon before this one & it lasted a good 15 yrs. This one cannot measure up & has disappointed us all......,1.0,1

I purchased the burgundy red hoping to keep my gold and burgundy colors in my room. When it arrived I was horrified. It was the ugliest burnt orange color that I have ever seen. Wal-Mart told me no returns during this pandemic. so I'm stuck using this gross color in my burgundy and gold room. I usually have really good experiences ordering so this is a first for me.,1.0,1
I bought the 8X10 Grey Flannel and I am so happy with it! Everywhere else I looked for a rug wanted way too much money for smaller rugs (and they also weren't the type I was looking for - shag) so I was quite surprised to see that this 8X10 was only $125. It came several days earlier than expected - bought it on a late Tuesday night and got it on Friday of the same week. I was a little weary about it not being "shaggy" enough but nope, it is perfect! After rolling it out, I laid on it for quite a while and ran my fingers and toes through the rug. Still hard to believe that I got this giant for such a great price. Not sure I understand what other reviewers mean about the "Cat urine smell", yeah it smells like new plastic but once I took off the plastic covering it doesn't smell too terrible.,5.0,1

I chose this model because I needed something to fit in a small space. It works well and looks nice in my remodeled kitchen. It's a lower power microwave, which I knew when I bought it, but in using it realize that I need to set the timer for nearly twice the time as my old full-power microwave. Not really a criticism, just an observation. Overall, I do like this microwave.,4.0,-1

I love keurig brewes, this is my third one, the first two were the orginal brewers, first one broke in a move cross country, I have had them for 4+ years and recieved the orange as a gift for christmas, It is usally just me that drinks coffee with my spouse ocassinaly, but I love the fact that when I do have people over I can brew a kraft, the customer service has always been great, and this is nice because if also gives you the option to use a water filter as well.,5.0,1
I wouldn't trust buying this item. It could have been that I just got ahold of the bad one, but mine leaked awfully bad. It was a real hard fit trying to get it on the wall faucet, when we finally did, it leaked BAD.... This I thought I could live with, until I started to use it, then the end that you hold was just as bad , if not worse.... Water everywhere, including on me. They must have had bad experiences with this hose before because I was immediately given my money back, no questions asked, and real quickly.... That I was satisfied with, but the hose is not worth it at all. The old saying 'you get what you pay for' certainly applies here!,1.0,1

I bought this in a twin size for my daughter's bed. It was true to size and vibrant. I washed and dried it before putting it on her bed and it came out fine. The only thing I dislike about this set is how silky it is. The fitted sheet tends to move around a lot and bunch, but I just pull and straighten it. Overall, it is very cute and great for the money!,4.0,1
Bed sheets are supposed to be soft, have that crisp feeling, and breathable; these are it! I do like my sheets to have that rich feeling that I find in most very nice hotels. Upon taking them out of the packaging, I immediately felt the thickness of the material and noticed how well the seams were sewn. Initially, I washed and dried them twice, just to see how they would hold up. I immediately took them out of the dryer, but they were a bit more wrinkled than I prefer, however, they were very soft. When I made up the bed, I again could feel the heaviness of the material; a good thing! Also, the fitted sheet had very deep corner pockets and extra width (easily tucked in), which should fit all queen-size mattresses. The flat sheet fit perfectly and the two full queen-sized pillow cases completed the bed. I wash my sheets in cold water, detergent - Woolite Gentle Cycle, on gentle cycle, extra rinse cycle helps, and no bleach. Dry on low-medium heat, no dryer fabric softener sheets, and take out immediately to reduce creases (scratchy). This seems to help keep my 100% Egyptian Cotton with a Sateen Weave sheets from snagging and balling up (taught this by my mother). The great thing with good 600 thread count Egyptian cotton sheets, properly laundered, is that they get softer and have fewer wrinkles with each wash; iron if you wish. If I could change one thing, I would have added another pair of pillow cases. Bottom line: a good price for great sheets.,5.0,1

At first I was very hesitant to buy this. There were enough good and bad reviews to keep me saying yes and no. So glad I took the chance. We loooooove it!
We bought the big 8x10 for our second living room/play room in gray color. It was wrapped well I guess but it looks like fedex kind of loves to drag it a bit here and there. Of course the plastic wrap might start ripping. Glad ours wasn't much to damage it. Unrolled it and in no time it laid flat. My 7&9 year olds came home from school and were laying all over it saying it was cozy. We own 2 very expensive $500 and $600 dollar rugs in our formal living and dining. This is the best rug ever and the price is so appealing. I would definitely recommend for a living room, play room and even bedroom over hardwood, tile or laminate.,5.0,1

The Modern Sleep Pillow Top 14” Hybrid Cool Gel Memory Foam and Innerspring Mattress is everything it says it is. The mattress is compressed in plastic, rolled in an additional layer of plastic, and placed in a tall box for speedy shipment. Shipping weight is 108 pounds and the mattress is in fact heavy. If you're in a place that has stairs, you will probably need some help getting the package in your home. Once inside, you can most likely handle the mattress to unpack it. I had no problem rolling and unwrapping the plastic, and then opening a corner side of the compressed area of plastic. After opening one corner, the air begins to release, take scissors and cut gently along that side. You can then remove the entire plastic along each side as the air continues to release. The mattress uncompressed readily and by the next day, it was almost at it's full 14”. The bottom layer of the mattress is innerspring and the top layer is the memory foam. I would say the mattress is semi-firm. The memory foam conforms to your body, whichever way you choose to sleep on it. I have lower back pain and as a norm, if I sleep longer than 4 hours, I literally have to roll out of bed in the mornings. With this mattress, I did not have the lower back pain. With that said, I have not had it long enough to say much in regards to back pain relief. I needed a bed in my small guest house and appreciate being able to sample this mattress as it will be great for guests/friends/family. I did notice the mattress keeps me cool in regards to not sweating. Usually I wake up with the back of my neck sweating but this didn't happen with this mattress. The mattress is virtually motionless which is great to say the least. Additional features besides being attractive, is the handles on all sides which helps in regards to moving the mattress. Presently I am awaiting the Modern Sleep platform bed that will accommodate this mattress perfectly. In regards to sheets, you would use your standard sheets but in regards to fitted sheets, slightly deep pockets is best. It may be time for you to break out of the old mattress sets and give the 'Modern Sleep Pillow Top Hybrid Cool Gel Memory Foam and Innerspring Mattress' a try.,5.0,1
I ordered these rugs because in the picture, it's grey, citron, white and brown. When they came, the colors are more like sage and white. No grey and no brown. I wish I had known about the color variation before I ordered. Also, they are described as "bath rugs", so I just assumed they would be rubber backed. Wrong. They are not rubber backed. Thankfully, I have a rug backer to put down to keep them from slipping around. I am trying to decide if I'm going to keep or return them.,2.0,1
One of these had a nozzle that would not seat properly in the hose coupling.  The other one shredded on the second day near the faucet connection.  

So the quality control at this factory appears to be in need of improvement.

To their credit, when I contacted the seller, they offered a prompt refund or replacement.  I chose replacement and hope the next two hoses last longer.

Also they said no need to send back defective units.,2.0,1

I really liked the design and pattern. however I figured there would have been some buttons or ties on the inside to fasten the comforter inside. the pillow shams are for bigger pillows so don't expect them to fit standard, average size pillows.

This item was returned.
I have no idea if it was of good value or not. It arrived by carrier covered in dirt and black grease. The plastic protective covering was completely torn off both ends and the rug was disgusting and smelled. Walmart should have used heavier plastic to protect the rug. The carrier (unmarked Fed Ex vehicle) should have rang the bell and allowed me to refuse receiving damaged goods. Instead she drug it to the door, yes she drug the 8x10 white rug through my grass, up a sidewalk and left it on my doorstep. She didn't ring the bell and tried to drove away fast and wouldn't stop when I waved at her and tried to stop her. I wanted to refuse the shipment or file a complaint with her or something. Bottom line, she knew it was horribly damaged and should have taken responsibility.
Upon returning it to my local Walmart store the sales associate was appalled that it was delivered to us in this shape. She suggested we complain. We did and we also chose not to repurchase from Walmart.com. We went to our local Kroger and paid $20 more for the same rug but this one was clean and packaged properly.,1.0,1
SUPER COMFORT: UNREAL!! This mattress was more than I expected. I woke up this morning NOT sore, which has not happened for a long time. This mattress is FIRM but gives enough to conform to your body. I'm a heavy person so this was a treat. The mattress does not sink in. The mattress does not feel like I'm sleeping in a valley or on a hill. I have had this mattress for about one week now and I have to say it is awesome. The box was a bit beat up but luckily the mattress was well protected. The mattress is firm, which was what I wanted and I have slept amazing, and the best part is the husband approves too.
The paperwork says that the bed will fully expand to its 14" height in 72 hours but you can sleep on it immediately. I'm guessing mine was around 7" - 8" when I set it up. I am getting a chemical smell as others have mentioned but it's tolerable. I know it will go away soon.
SET UP NOTES: This mattress comes rolled up & compressed, packed in vacuum sealed plastic with an outer layer of thick plastic protection. It is extremely heavy. It is rolled up from head to foot so expect a roll that is as long as your bed is wide. I recommend you first remove your old mattress. Then drag this heavy box "intact" into the bedroom. From there open the box and remove the roll. Discard the box to make room. I could not do this project alone. I highly recommend two people. Lift the roll onto your bed, centered across, so that it will fill the bed when unrolled. THEN, carefully remove the outer plastic wrapping. Next, begin to open the vacuum seal plastic. Scissors and a knife will work but you must be VERY careful not to cut the mattress. I found I could PULL most of the plastic apart. The mattress will begin to unroll while doing this. Once all of the plastic is removed, finish unrolling the mattress and nudge into position. It is still quite heavy and tough to move.

I MUST HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MATTRESS. IT WILL BE AN EXCELLENT PURCHASE!,5.0,1
Look, I get it, these things can be expensive so you're thinking for the price, why not. Just don't. These are absolute JUNK. The material smashes down to nothing within a couple of weeks but you can feel the poor quality even before they're pretty much useless. Sure they have lots of colors and patterns to choose from but that doesn't make them any better.,1.0,1

These rugs are thick and soft to the feet and keeps the cold away.  I just had my bathroom redone with a rock floor in my shower and these rugs matched so well and looks so great.

I am very happy with  these rugs.,5.0,1
We were extremely happy to receive this mattress. Absolutely fantastic bed. We previously had a King size mattress that was very old and uncomfortable so we desperately needed a new mattress. The Modern Sleep Pillow Top 14" Hybrid Cool Gel Memory Foam and Innerspring Mattress is a great mattress especially for the price. When the mattress arrived, it was very tightly packaged. When I saw it, I actually thought maybe it was just the pillow top portion and that the mattress was still on the way. Once you cut away the plastic the mattress quickly absorbs air and instantly expands to full size so you will want to open it wherever you plan on keeping it. It is much easier to get through doorways or staircases while it is still compressed. It does however say it may take 24 to 72 hours to fully expand. We found that by the second night it was perfect . I would not consider this a firm matress by any means yet is is very supportive. It's kind of hard to explain until you actually lay on the matttress, I would say it is more on the soft side. The innersprings in the bottom 8 inch portion of the mattress offer plenty of support but the top potion with the memory foam and gel and in the pillowtop is very soft and contours to your every curve. It feels like heaven and is extremely comfortable. When you lay on it your body sinks down into the memory foam a bit. The memory foam top also isolates movments so it does not transfer to the other person sleeping on the other half of the mattress. My husband loves this. We have a 6 week old baby so I am constantly getting up throughout the night and now with this new mattress I don't wake him every time I get out of bed. I can even rock the baby as I sit up in the bed and he is able to stay sound asleep. Previously both my husband and I were waking every morning with lower back pain because of our old mattress. This mattress has completely resolved that issue. I just wish I had this mattress sooner during my pregnancy as it would have saved me a lot of pain and suffering. I also love that it kees you cool at night. I have not woken up in a hot sweat once yet since having our new mattress. I normally have to sleep with a fan on to stay cool but the gel infused memory foam dispurses heat and draws heat away from your body. Having a new baby I really need to make the most of the little bit of sleep I get. The bed feels like a dream and I feel like you really get the most bang for your buck. After we received this mattress we just happened to be at the mall in a department store where I layed on a few other hybrid mattresses and the Modern Sleep mattress was just as comfortable but cost less than half their price. I don't know why anyone would pay all that money for a mattress when this one is just as nice. Really a great value on a beautiful matress.,5.0,1

The description says the sheet fits up to an 18 inch mattress. My mattress is 18 inches. It does go on and stay put, for the most part, bit it does slide up the side of the mattress occasionally. Its possible thats due to my vinyl mattress protector being a little slick. The only thing that bugs me and isnt even really a problem is the elastic band doesn't be go completely under the mattress all the way around. It tucks on the corners but not the middle portions of each side. It could be my ocd or the fact that the sheet isn't deep enough. The sheet set is super comfy and my boyfriend, who doesn't even like a top sheet, now sleeps under this one because it feels great.,4.0,-1

We have 4 of these in different places including one we keep for use in hotels on road trips - perfect for two people with different tastes in roasting strength and brew strength.  I prefer this smaller water reservoir as I am not leaving water sit for longer periods between refills.  We have had Keurigs of several kinds for many years - this has been our best choice.  Now - I just hope they do not quit making it or change the pods again!,5.0,1

Holy cow! Their version of taupe is NOT what arrived. Luckily, I knew what taupe meant and I got exactly what I wanted, but if you think you're getting that chocolate brown color, you will be very disappointed!!

This White Floral leaf queen duvet cover boho set is beautiful. It's especially beautiful for Spring and Summer months. I consistently changing out bed attire simply because I like to keep my bedroom updated. I guess one could say I change my bedrooms with the seasons. This set is also lovely for a guest bedroom. The queen size is 90 x 90 and includes pillowcases. The pillowcases have the end fold cover so that your pillows are completely covered by the case AND that fold also has the flower design. Right out of the package, the material is so soft to the touch. It has a bottom zipper to open and close for changing whatever type of blanket/comforter you place it in. Machine washable. The colors are in fact vibrant. The assortment of colors in the design results in a easy way to compare it with other colors and additional pillows. If you want to know how easy it is to insert a blanket/comforter into a duvet cover, there are fantastic videos online that show how.,5.0,1

So, I love coffee, maybe a little to much. I have wanted a Keurig for some time now and Have finally got my hands on one! Yayyy me! (It was my birthday, umm, my 25th one. That will be my only lie in this review, promise!) My son has decided to send me to coffee rehab. I have had a Mr.Coffee KCup brewer for a while and it has worked beautifully and makes a great cup of coffee, but what can I say, Its like driving a nice car but you dream of a cadillac. Anyway, I purchased the "Strawberry" colored Keurig 2.0 200 today. It was a hard choice between it and the blue, both are beautiful. So, out with Mr.Coffee and in with Mrs.Keurig :) I have made around 4 cups of coffee today and have been impressed so far. Hopefully I will not be let down. For me this was a pricey purchase. (I'm not poor, but I'm not rolling around in the dough either) I have to budget what I do, but I feel this product so far is worth what I have invested. Fingers crossed that I can come back to this site in a year and still rave about this Gorgeous Machine that has taken over my life. Thanks Keurig! :),5.0,1

After owning the eggplant color set for over a year they are still in great condition! The sound goes away after a couple washings. And youre left with sheets that wonât come off every night bc they have this wonderful wide elastic around the bottom. I found another sheet set with that wide elastic band from kohls (Columbia brand I think) but they were twice the cost of these.  We have a california king mattress but the regular king sheets, stay on and fit just fine. Highly recommend!,5.0,1

Very impressed with the quality of the pad, it is thick, firm but comfortable, and feels like leather! The stool is well-balanced and bottom cusion pads were already attached to the bottom of the legs. The wood is well-milled and instructions were excellent. Packaging was excellent.

I recommend that you attach the legs in the order shown in the instructions, but only attach them loosely, just good enough that they wobble in place because you need wiggle room to slip the rungs in.

The only problem I see with quality is that the rungs appear to be slightly off-angle where they are supposed to touch the legs. For this reason, I recommend that you attach the rungs in the order listed in the instructions, but in addition I recommend that you use a good wood glue in the rung holes and use a good standard electric drill to attach the rungs securely with the screws to pull them tight into to the holes in the legs (the wood of the legs is hard enough to withstand a powerful drill, but likely not hard enough for an overly powerful drill only because of the size of the notch).

Next, tighten the tops of the legs to secure the legs. The upper legs require the hex tool provided to tighten, and I was able to hand-tighten securely enough that I do not believe they would ever loosen given that the hardware included a grip washer.

I believe the advice I am giving is likely the reason that others claim the stools are bad quality because they likely didn't secure everything as well as it should have been done.

These bar stools are heavy and they are more solid and sturdy after assembly than the more expensive high-end bar chairs I own!  Do not be afraid to purchase these stools! They are a VERY GOOD VALUE FOR YOUR MONEY!!!,5.0,1

I love the comforter set, however the valances are not 84 inches long as stated, so they will not work on my windows since I do have one very large window in the room. The comforter is a King size which fits but it just fits and hangs over just enough no extra overhang at all and it is very thin.  It is very pretty and I am happy with it but it could use a few improvements. I was shocked that there is no bed skirt in the set I was definitely disappointed about that but that is my fault as it does not list one in the description of what is included,3.0,-1

I purchased the K200 to replace a true single cup Keurig. It worked great for a bout 5 months. Now I have to babysit it just to get one cup of coffee. It only gives you about 2 oz, of less each time. It takes about 4 to five times to get one cup, I tried just the hot water function and it seems to work fine. I tried cleaning it and it made only full cup and then went back to its old ways. I use it at work. We have an older Keurig at home that has worked great. My frustration level is on the rise and I almost feel like tossing the thing in the trash.,1.0,1

If these plugs are planted the recommended 12" apart, it will require THREE (3) flats of 18 plugs.   NOT one as implied here.

You will find this out as soon as you start prepping your lawn OR if you contact the company and find someone who will even bother to try to answer the question.  Took me two days and half a dozen calls.

It takes a lot to get me upset in the morning when I wake up. So imagine how upset I was when I could not make my first cup of coffee of the day ! I love the Keurig brand, but I love my coffee more. And this new 2.0 is not compatible with my reusable filter ! So i had to disconnect the new 2.0 and put in my old Keurig Elite B45 Brewer which accepts all types of reusable filters. I am on a fixed income and cannot afford to buy a specific filter or buy the Keurig brand K-cups. so most likely I will return this 2.0 ! As I stated before I love my coffee more than a machine to make it !!! Yes I like the touch screen and yes I like the compact design. I also like the fact that I can add a carafe as well and I am upset that I will not be able to enjoy these amenities ! I was really excited and was brimming with anticipation to use this Keurig 2.0 K200 ! And now with one issue(reusable filter),my hopes were shattered, and my morning ruined ! Thanks Keurig !,1.0,1

First of all I have the red one and it is such a pretty color. I love that it allows you to wrap the cord underneath the waffle maker for easy storage.  It has a blue indicator light which tells you that the waffle maker is warm. Once you put the batter in and close it will tell you when it is done. I love that it has a setting for the waffle crispness. I used setting #4 and it came out perfect! So easy to use and absolutely fail proof.,5.0,-1

Very nice quality.  Was wrinkled when arrived as expected.  Sprinkled with a little water and put in dryer on low and then ironed out remaining wrinkles.  Ironed really well.

I bought this smart keurig for my RV travels.  This is the 5 th keurig that I own.  I know you can only use one at a time!  What can I say, I'm an addict!

I am extremely disappointed with the new Keurig 2.0. It will NOT accept any of my old coffee pods that my previous Keurig did. I am disappointed the Keurig would make their customers buy their brand of coffee in order to be able to use the machine. I cannot return this machine to the store where I purchased it so I will be trashing it and buying another brand machine that will accept any manufacturer K cups. I loved my previous Keurig and was excited to get this one for Christmas. What a disappointment to find out I have an entire drawer full of flavored coffee's (sorry Keurig, not your brand) that won't work. Will never buy another Keurig again and have posted to my FB for all my friends to not buy one either for this reason.,1.0,1
This is a nice piece for the price. I ordered it in the white color. Be aware that the package will be extremely heavy when delivered and hard to move. Once I opened the package, I found all the screws and nails had fell out of bag they were in and were unsorted. I think I must have received one that someone had previously tried to put together, but gave up in frustration and returned. Unfortunately the almost 20 pieces of wood were not clearly mark as indicated in the direction and a few pieces had minor scratches (they are labeled, but just really hard to find). Once I spent about 2 hours just sorting and organizing the nails, screws, and wood, the process went smoothly. It took about another 5 hours to put together.,4.0,1
I have struggled with this contraption from over a year. Why would you design something that infuriates your customers? Absolutely no pods will work with this thing. Why would you do this? I have never owned an appliance I want to destroy on a daily basis until now.,1.0,1
When we moved we had to leave our Keurig behind. I found the orange K250 and it fit our new decor perfectly.

There is no choice for K250! ;-(,5.0,1
These cushions are too thin and after using them a few times they all got a permanent indentation in them right in the middle of the seat.  The chairs they are on are solid so it's not due to the shape of the chair.  Now if it rains the seats fill with water and have to be tipped over to pour all the water out.  They are also very uncomfortable since they are so thin.  It's like sitting on the metal chair.  I will definitely spend a little more next time and get better quality cushions.,1.0,1
My parents have an older Keurig that I hate to use because it takes so long to heat up. I do not have that problem with this brewer, at all! I'm a college student and this Keurig is great for when I am on my way out the door running late for class! As some other reviewers have said the water tank is a little hard to get on and off but I'm sure it will get easier with time. I also wish there was a larger clearance underneath where the coffee comes out, sometimes I have troubles fitting my travel mugs under it. I'm not a fan of the fact that you HAVE to use their special K-cups now, because even some old K-cups that have the Keurig logo on them do not work.I do love that you can select from several different coffee and hot water sizes along with if you want your coffee strong or if you are brewing hot chocolate!,4.0,1
I have 3 of these rugs in different colors.  I don't put them in the washer but I found that I can wash them on the patio with mild soap, rinse with the hose then hang them over a chair to dry and they dry nicely.  It's a nice rug for the price.,4.0,1

Do yourself a favor and please do not purchase this product. I purchased my initial brewer in June and am now going to be on my 3rd...yes third brewer. It seems as if the brewer works for about 3-4 weeks and then it completely stops functioning. I called customer service this morning, and although both workers I spoke to over the last two months were polite; I was told that the best they could do was send me a new brewer. The warranty for a cash refund is thirty days from the point of original purchase. I am tired of this machine and having to waste my valuable time talking to customer service, wasting k cups, and spending time at FedEx (you have to send pack a part within 30 days in order to be offered the free replacement.) I was understanding when this happened the first time, but now I am beyond frustrated. How can you not offer me a cash refund when you have already had to ship me two replacements? What does that tell you about the quality of the product? I saw some questionable reviews before I purchased this product, and if I could go back, I would have listened. I had always been a fan of Keurig and had the Vue in the past. Never again.,1.0,1
Color was way off I was expecting a nice gold yellow color but what I received was an icky light pee yellow color...very disappointed.

The fabric if the sheets is tightly woven, which is nice. But I guess I didn't understand what "printed" meant. I received the sheets, washed them, and when I got them or if the dryer they looked puckered; like the fabric shrank but the (screen printed?) pattern did not. I'm going to wash them again and see if I can't wear down the screen print. I will NOT be putting them on my bed as is.,3.0,1
I received my Keurig 2.0 K200 for Christmas. I ran water through it multiple times to get the plastic taste out. The next day it kept occurring and everything tasting disgusting. I went online to see if anyone else has been having the same issue and I wasn't the only one. Online it said to run vinegar and water through it and I ran about 3-4 containers through. The smell and taste was finally gone. Well until the next day. I went to make a cup of coffee and it tasted like plastic coffee. Is anyone else having this issue?,1.0,1

This mattress is excellent, I have three bad disks in my back and stenosis. This mattress is FIRM but comfortable. I had a Serta before this one and it sagged bad after only 4 months. I'm 170 lbs and was shocked that an expensive Serta mattress would sag so bad. It was terrible. But this new Modern Sleep Pillow Top 14" Hybrid Cool Gel Memory Foam and Inner Spring Mattress is just what I needed. My back pain when I first get up in the morning in not nearly as bad as before. Time will tell how well it holds up and doesn't sag but this mattress seems MUCH better made that the Serta I had before. I tried to get Serta to warranty the mattress and did all they asked including pictures and after all the fuss, they told me they had no reps in the area to come see for themselves and stopped all contact with me. So I will NEVER buy another Serta product. If you are looking for a FIRM mattress and a great price  this is it. BUT... The shipping was very bad on my new mattress. The mattress comes compressed in vacuum sealed plastic but the box was torn so bad that they actually tore the vacuum bag and the only thing left keeping it from flying open was the other thick plastic wrapped around it. So it was a chore cutting open the thick plastic because it was trying to spring open rapidly and causing damage to other objects in the room. So I had to lay it on a open area in the living room and let it fly open without breaking anything lol.. It took about 8 hours for the mattress to take full shape and expand. Fantastic mattress for the money.,5.0,1

I consider myself to be the queen of assembly required furniture. Rarely do I need the instructions, although I always glance at them. These pieces were marked. But being a nurse I always question is it the right side looking at the item from the front or the right side as if I were sitting on it. The most import parts such as up and down of the top and bottom supports weren't marked so it took a little trial and error. There is a piece of paper that gives you a number you can call if you have a problem, but I wasn't willing to accept defeat. The piece is very nice look very nice, the wood arms are black and not espresso as I had pictured in my mind but they were well packed and nothing was damaged. I got the 8" mattress which is very nice and comfortable, but I can't put the bed in sitting position by myself without taking the mattress off. I would recommend this for anyone but just know it is a little trial and error for the set-up.,3.0,1
These sheets have the classic satin stitch at the top for understated beauty, and they would go well with almost every style of decor for that reason. Other sheets can be limp and lifeless, and sleeping on them is not really much of an experience. That is definitely not the case with these sheets. These sheets are crisp and full of body. Just putting them on the bed makes you look forward to bedtime. I feel pampered when I get into bed and sleeping on their pearly smooth texture is dreamy - they don't bunch or pull off the mattress. They also don't crease easily so they look good even after being slept on.
The best features have to be the wide elastic all the way around the fitted sheet and the elasticized pocket seam. My mattress is only 12 inches thick, so the fitted sheet curled under about 8 inches all the way around. But it didn't bulge or cause the mattress to be bumpy - it was very neat and smooth. This is important when you have a raised metal foundation (as opposed to a box spring) because extra linen can sometimes fall through the wire mesh under the mattress and look messy.
I liked these sheets so much, I recommended them to my mom.,5.0,1
I needed to replace the mattress that I had I also was on a tight budget so I went online researched a few  came across this one on a YouTube review I decided to research it a little bit more kind of worried about purchasing the set I went on ahead and purchased it anyway and I absolutely love it it sleeps well it doesn't goes flat it's in between firm and soft I suffer with back problems and it does help out the box spring you do have to put together it's not that hard to do hope this review helps you won't be disappointed it's been about a month and I'm still satisfied with purchase,5.0,1

I recently tried out the grill and I only having positive feedback! The grill is fast and easy to set up with no mess. I cooked my chicken breast in record time and the chicken came out perfect. This is for sure a keeper and I will be using it daily. You just set whatever you want to cook on the grill, close the cover and walk away. In minutes you'll have the best meal ever! Clean up is easy and it's perfect for cooking meals for 2 people. I highly recommend!,5.0,1

Blinds are very thin. They don't filter light as thought. You have to be very careful moving blinds up/down. The blind came off the roller and detached after rolling up and down .

This is a great doormat!  It's bigger than I expected, even though I knew the dimensions.  I love it!  It fits perfectly in front of the door.

Perfect classic size, color, style for a guest room or entry-way loveseat. This piece will not be getting daily use or heavy wear & tear in my home; the low back and light fabric probably wouldn't make it comfortable for use as a regular couch.

The chest is exactly as it appears on-line. It is heavier than I expected and so the craftsmanship is definitely of high quality & seems like it will last for a long time. I just received it so I cannot comment on its durability just quite yet. The only reason I didn't give a rating of 5 stars is because the bottom is just slightly off in terms of evenness and so I may have to stick on one of those scratch resistant pads underneath 1 of the legs to make sure that it's level. I loved the fact that it came already assembled, which is one of the biggest reasons I decided to make this purchase- I didn't want to have to put together yet another piece of furniture for the baby nursery.,4.0,-1

Oh my gosh what a difference this makes!! Let me start off by saying my other mattress was only 4 years old. When I bought it 4 years ago I thought I was getting a good mattress.

After reviewing slipcovers online and reading many reviews, I ordered this item. Imagine my surprise when I found it absolutely doesn't fit my recliner, even though I measured to be sure. The back section fits. The seat and leg lift do come close, but there's no way to secure it at the back of the seat. The elastic just isn't enough to do the job. And the arms!!!! There's no way they fit. You can get them on the arm, but they do not reach all the way down and there's no opening for the handle on the side of the chair. I ended up keeping it because the back of the chair has worn out and this fabric matches the leather almost perfectly. After looking at other slipcovers online, they were more than I wanted to spend and who knows if they'd fit any better. Looked at fabric store to make it myself, but couldn't match the color and making the entire slipcover was cost prohibitive. Don't do it.,1.0,1
This rack is certainly an improvement over my old one. However, I was very disappointed when virtually half of the black rubber caps FELL OFF the legs when I removed it from the box. Some were easy to reseat, others were too small to stay in place. This leaves the raw, unfinished metal tube open to scratch and scrape on our hardwood floors. Haven't figured out how to fix this problem yet --- superglue? Until I do, I am keeping the rack but using it very cautiously. Not bad, but still disappointing.,3.0,1

This is great but when I ordered it I wasn't thinking about the amount of tags. I have hung it up and put all my birthdays on the tags and I need more.

I've had them for 6 months and I still say ""oh yeah"" out loud every time I crawl in. I look forward to crawling back in before I have crawled out. They are luxury sheets at a budget price.

This was the perfect size for a small room and the hutch fit two large monitors! Perfect for my new home office and if was less than 200! Great price! My husband said the instructions were simple, a lot of pieces, but simple and it didnt take him long to build. We got the grey oak instead of black and I'm super happy, its beautiful. One thing I was bummed about was a small crack where one of the bolts goes, but husband said it wasnt part of the foundation so it didnt affect the sturdiness. We used to work in furniture,  so it's understandable when you're buying stuff that arrives in a box. Regardless,  I love my desk!,5.0,1

From the dawn of creation man has sought ways to relieve himself from the pain of having to stand erect. At first there was the ground and then the rock and then the sculptured rock and then tree stump and then elegantly carved thrones of wood and jewels. This chair is the next evolutionary accomplishment. With its 4 full legs of support and a flat surface to sit on it is an innovation all its own....I am surprised treasures like this are available for such a modest price.

I got this as a gift for my birthday and I took it off to my college apartment.

The hose connections are metric or something. They do not fit standard American hose threads. They come with built in quick connectors that can't be removed, so you have to use their adapters which don't fit American threads. 

Since I couldn't even hook it up, I can't say how it worked cause it didn't.

It's a Walmart "Marketplace" seller so I can't take it back to Walmart. It's not worth my hassle to return it to the vendor so I guess I'll just eat it. $14.99  + shipping.

This hutch is really nothing more than particle board held together by nails. The piece was damaged in multiple spots when it was delivered, and simply assembling it causes damage because the cheap material can not handle the hardware used. In addition, it needs to be anchored or any weight will cause it to tip. We were very disappointed in this purchase.,1.0,1
These are great sheets, especially for the price.  When we first opened the package I thought they were cheaply made since they were so light.  I was pleasantly surprised at how light and soft they are while being very well made.  They have held up well in the washer and dryer.  The best part for me is that they truly have deep pockets and fit our 16 inch mattress very easily.,5.0,-1

This brewer is great, in theory. I have been trying to use it for all different brands and drinks available in k-cup form. The My K-cup does not work. Dark roast Newman's own doesn't work. Starbucks Verona blend doesn't work. Snapple iced teas don't work. I am pretty disappointed that I need to keep an old keurig around when I have such a gorgeous, fast, convenient machine.,2.0,1
Everyone always brags that they have a Keurig, so I had a Black and Decker that did not like to brew the same size cup each time I used it. SO I finally went and bought a new Keurig. I AM UPSET that I can not brew my own coffee in an aftermarket pod where I add coffee to it like I could with my last one. I like being able to do this for one it is way cheaper. SO does Keurig only care about sales and NOT the customer. If they do not change this and make an adapter to let me do this, then I will look for a replacement so I can use my own coffee. I can not believe that I can't and I am very upset about this But no one from Keurig will see this and based on them not letting me brew my own coffee I can only assume they don't care.,2.0,1
I would have given 5 stars but the only complaint that I have is that it is not a thick comforter. It's really thin, and the shams are see through so I will haven to purchase be white pillowcases to put underneath them. Other than that it isn't really pretty and true to the picture shown.,4.0,-1
Received as a gift & will return. Too much plastic waste and very environmentally unfriendly (can't imagine justifying all that plastic sitting in landfills from these machines). And, the cost is just ridiculous not to mention the maintenance. We use a few ceramic and glass Melitta style over the cup cones that work wonderfully for great tasting coffee with a cost of less than $20. They are easy and quick to clean and most importantly are environmentally friendly. Rather than using this machine at the present cost of the pods I would just go out to have coffee at Starbucks if I wanted to waste money.,2.0,1

I am happy with this new product because though it seems to plug up more often from coffee grounds it has been very easy to clean compared to the older model. It is a very convenient system we all know that, makes a good cup of coffee and allow you to vary the strength. My frustration with the older model was getting clogged up and slow brewing. My new 2.0 suddenly stopped brewing one day and support walked me through cleaning it with the included cleaning tool. What a difference it was back brewing like the first day. So I need to do this monthly but if that is all I have to do and it keeps on brewing like it does its a small price to pay. So far a much improved model compared to the first one. The screen is easy to use to make your size and strength selection and the big flashing button to brew couldn't be easier. Quick and easy clean up and have not run into any issues with odd brands not working. If find some brands are not maybe up to the same standards as others. I like 8 o'clock Italian Roast but the foil top gets rips and enlarged during use and causes grounds to plug up the works (ergo the cleaning) but since I switched to another brand I don't have that problem. We just ordered a K350 to replace the old B45 in the kitchen.,4.0,1
I purchased 2 of these in the charcoal with the white flower pattern. They're extremely sturdy and easy to put together - but I highly recommend using a socket wrench with a hex attachment, instead of the tool provided - to minimize stress on hands.

This is the first indoor grill that I've used. We've had waffle irons and sandwich presses, but this one is almost the best of both.

Let me start by saying that I LOVE that you can pull the grill plates off and drop them in the dishwasher. My main complaint with our waffle iron is that I have to go chasing remnants through the grid with a cotton swab. No such issues here.

I tried it with chicken breasts, grilled cheese, and turkey bacon. Worked like a charm and pretty quickly.

The one thing that could be a negative is that the drip tray doesn't attach at all. It just kind of nestles under the front and counts on you not to move anything too much while you're cooking. All in all, a great buy and a solid recommendation from me.,5.0,1

Had loved my Keurig 1 from the day I bought it. Was excited to upgrade to a 2 so I could brew more than 1 cup at a time. Thus I purchased the carafe. It worked once or twice but then started showing "add more water" each time thereafter that I attempted to use the carafe. I tried everything but no success. I called customer service and together they through many ways to try to make it work. It continued the message to add more water even though it was full. It was finally decided that I would receive a replacement. Unfortunately the same thing happened. It was replaced again and when I had guests for dinner last week the same thing happened. How embarrassing!!!  This must be happening frequently to other users as well. There is definitely a flaw in the design. I don't want another replacement so what do I do with all the carafe size pods that I recently bought?  I am soooo disappointed with the Keurig 2 and will have to start with a new system. Wouldn't you expect to receive a refund?,1.0,1

Received the Modern Sleep mattress to review as part of a consumer program. Upon arrival, I unwrapped the mattress to allow it to expand. I was already impressed with the quality of the fabric on the mattress. The mattress was plush and thick due to the various layers of material from which the mattress was created. I could not wait to allow the mattress to fully expand to see how it slept. Once I put it on the bed, I was amazed at how it compared to my last mattress. This mattress is firm—but in a good way. I have a memory foam pillow, but with this mattress I will have to resort to something a little softer to balance the firmness of the mattress. It does not sway or compromise with more than one person on the bed. Because it is a hybrid mattress, you get the best of both worlds. You get the flexibility of an innerspring, but the comfort and support that goes along with a memory foam mattress. This mattress superseded my expectations. Because this mattress is 14”, deep pocket sheets would be a wise investment. I see this mattress being an investment in my home for years to come.,5.0,1

I've tried these types of hoses several times throughout the years to see if they get made better. But obviously they're not every time I purchase these type of hoses they always have hoes in the holse itself. There functionality is good The pressure is good they work well but it's speuting water out of several holes in the neck of the hose. So while you're working with it you're getting soaking wet other than that it's a great hose but they always seem to have damage around the neck of the hose not sure why I will be returning it and buying another one and trying it again this is like the third and fourth time I get this type of hose and they don't last or they come damage,2.0,1

I resisted buying a Keurig for years, because I hated the cost and waste (still do). With that said, it does make decent coffee and is super convenient. However, this new system clogs constantly (like, on the 3rd use!). I finally figured out that if I used the Rogers cups (the ones with paper bottoms instead of plastic), it no longer clogged...and tasted better! I resent the fact that this new system won't let you fill your own cups, when in my experience it's their own cups breaking the darned thing in the first place. Google "Freedom Clip" for a workaround.,2.0,1

Not very happy just got the unit for my birthday and not even a week later having issues. Call the number and the lady was very nice and tried to help. First I told her that this unit has already cost me 7 pods at almost $2 per pod that was around $14 down the drain. And I was not happy. Then she told me I should clean the unit once a week. I told her I would when it came to a week. LOL. I told her I only use the ones with their logo on it to insure it would work and she told me to try too clean it. In short 3 cleans later and over 40oz of H2O and two more pods ($4) they are sending me a new POD holder and a coupon for 1 Free Hot Bev Box/Bag. On the unit I would give about 1 stars. (I did get some coffee out of it. LOL) On the service I would give 4 starts (because I give no one 5 because there is always room to improve.) We will have to see how it goes after the new POD holder.,1.0,1

Wow!   I am in my mid 50's and have been sleeping on waterbeds or futons since I was 14.  This was my first real mattress.  We replaced it as the quality of waterbed mattresses really has gone down hill in recent years (too many leaks).  

So glad we did!   

Given our bedroom is on a 3/4 height floor of our house atop a narrow "S"-curve stairway, we wanted something that could get up there.  My husband and I are both over 6' tall, so a KING is the only size we can sleep on.  We tested out the conventional "Mattresses in a box", but felt like we were laying on a  squishy marshmallow.   A traditional mattress would never get around the bend up to the second floor.  

Then we found this hybrid memory foam / coil spring!  It IS 125 pounds, but two of us wrangled the compressed, rolled  mattress up the stairs.   It unfurled and expanded to near full size within an hour, and we let it "breathe" for about 8 hours before putting on the bedding.   The packing odor had completely dissipated by the time we turned in.  

This mattress is EXCEPTIONAL!  So absolutely comfortable!   No sensation other than total support where we needed it!   No motion, no sense of any movement of the bed (like when either you get in or our of bed for a 2AM bathroom call) - all you get is just a PERFECTLY UNINTERRUPTED night of sleep!   

The mattress comes with a 10 year warranty.   Hopefully we will not need to remove it any time soon (though the full mattress going DOWN the stairs would probably be a lot easier than UP).  There are positioning straps on all four sides and two people can easily maneuver the unit around if it needs to be moved.  

JUST ONE WORD OF ADVICE - Make SURE you have the correct side of the mattress facing UP before you let it unfurl...  We did kinda hit that snag but managed to quickly flip it over before it became too big.,5.0,1

LOVED the color, and got a great deal. Got it set up, and discovered that it will NOT use any off-brand K-cups, only Keurig-approved/branded ones.

By far the one of the worst purchases made!  This is my 3rd Keurig now (3rd unit being a warranty replacement).  1st old style unite was great but both 2.0 units pop the internal filter in k-cups and brew a cup full of grounds.  Such a waste of money.  Would not recommend buying.  Next unit will be a Ninja coffee bar.  Same features without the hassle,1.0,1

I was very disappointed when I received my new Keurig only to find out it does not brew a 12oz cup of coffee with a regular K-cup.

I purchased the Keurig 2.0 and am Extremely Disappointed that it does not brew a 12oz cup using a regular Kcup. The ad states it brews a 4oz to 30 oz which is only true if you are using special kcups for the mug and carafe. The older Keurig that I owned was capable of brewing a 12 oz cup. Wish I still had my old one. I am returning the Keurig. In addition, you have to keep setting the cup size to a 10 oz each time you brew a cup. You cannot program it to stay on the 10oz brew size. Very poor technology.,2.0,1

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Everything about this umbrella gets a top notch rating from me!

I wasn't sure what had arrived on our doorstep in a tall, heavy box. Since it was very heavy -- about 100 pounds -- we decided to load it on a dolly. We got it inside and it turned out it was our rolled-up mattress. We cut off the plastic carefully from the bag it was compressed and rolled into, and out popped the Modern Sleep Pillow Top 14" Hybrid Cool Gel Memory Foam and Innerspring Mattress.

We flattened it out and let it completely expand itself to its full size, which is just under 14 inches tall. The base is about 9 inches tall, and includes the springs. The pillow top layer is nearly 5 inches tall. They are connected, and the mattress would need to lay on a flat surface, not just a regular metal bed-frame alone, but would need a box spring (with or without springs), or something like that to work comfortably. The fabric it's covered with is pleasantly soft, so if the sheets get pulled off a corner, it's not uncomfortable. There are two strong, fabric straps well-sewn into each side, which is really nice and helpful for moving it.

The mattress is easily the most soft and comfortable mattress we've ever owned. It's supportive yet giving wherever I need it, and works very well regardless of how I am sleeping. It also remains soft, comfy, and cool throughout the night.,5.0,1

I love these sheets and this is a great price! I have been hunting for a good pair of sheets for a few months now and these are perfect. Cool, crisp, soft and with a good weight to them. These remind me of the sheets my Grandma had. They are cotton so they will wrinkle, not too bad straight from the dryer though. They are also "noisy" as other reviewers stated but that doesn't bother me, only adds to their appeal. I have a 12 inch mattress and these fit perfectly. If you are used to microfiber sheets these will seem rough but they will continue to soften up with washing. I think these will last for quite some time and I plan on purchasing more as soon as they have the King size back in stock. Very satisfied customer.,5.0,1

I'd been wanting for a while. A long while. Finally Black Friday I bought this thing. (First Black Friday purchase ever, too!) I got the Strawberry, and it's adorable. I'd heard people complain it stays on all the time, and then complain that it has to keep "preheating" ... well, if it stays on all the time it doesn't. LOL I have not had a single messed up pod, and my mom had some old ones she'd gotten as samples - and they worked. The only oops message we got was when my son didn't close it all the way. I originally wanted the bigger unit, but I bought this one because 1. it was on incredible sale, and 2. I wanted Strawberry. My initial thoughts were "Well, I don't drink THAT much coffee and the smaller reservoir won't be that big a problem ... besides all I'd really be upgrading for would be a color screen and color changing light in the reservoir ........ right?" I was wrong. Cracks me up how often we're refilling the thing. But that just shows how much we love it. It's getting a big workout. Bottom line: Keurig, where have you been all my life?,5.0,1

The first unit we received appeared to have been dropped, smashing one end of the package before it was edged and bound for shipping. I immediately called Wayfair and they set up to send us a second unit, assuring me that the chances of us getting another damaged one was extremely slim. Upon examining the second unit I found the damage to both units was very similar. This leads me to believe the damage was actually done during manufacture. I will never buy anything that is manufactured by Hodedah Imports again. All the materials are so sub-standard that it was difficult to find enough parts from the two kits to put together one functional unit.

Anyone considering a mattress topper is going to think hard about what to do with existing sheets. Save yourself the headache by buying these fitted sheets first out the gate. If they seem a bit large at first blush, consider this. Simply tuck in the excess. The spandex gathering takes up the slack anyway. So when you get that mattress topper, you have the excess already.

This is my first Keurig and I couldn't be more excited to write about how amazing it is! It is SUPER easy to set up, quick to brew and quiet. The little touch screen gives clear step by step instructions on what to do next which is great. K-cups came with the Keurig which was amazing since I didn't have any just laying around but wanted to try it right away! My first cup was English Breakfast Tea. I'm not a huge coffee drinker so tea is my preferable option and this tea was amazing. Fresh. It took me back to my first encounter with Breakfast Tea on my trip to Ireland a few years back. It is now my special treat on the mornings that the kids actually sleep in a little and I have some (rare) time for myself. I have even tried several of the coffee blends and they are very good! They are fresh and of higher quality. I prefer my coffee brewed over ice so I froze some of my favorite creamer and brewed it right over those cubes and it was amazing! It has me so excited for the warmer weather that is coming as it will replace my morning cup of hot tea. My husband has jumped right on the coffee train with me and drinks a LOT more of it than I do and is absolutely loving the Keurig .It's easy to make and maintain and no clean up after it's brewed right in to your cup! His one word after his first sip was, delicious. So all in all - 5 stars for the Keurig 2.0 machine itself as it is sleek, modern, and perfect for a home kitchen counter. I've yet to read on other special things it can do but for the morning cup of coffee - it's perfect! I'm excited to play with new settings and recipes and see just exactly all of the things that it will have to offer. I've seen recipes for oatmeal, soups and more and I can't wait to try them out! The k-cups they sent with it are fantastic. There is quite the variety to choose from and each one I've had so far is supper yummy! I'm excited about expanding what I already know is going to be my k-cup collection and even learning about how to re-purpose the cups and grounds and make every little bit count! So if you're in the market for a new coffee maker - go for the higher end and snatch a Keurig - it's well worth every penny!,5.0,1

Nice, high quality sheets are all cotton which is important if you hate when your sheets "pill". These came out of the package smoothly ironed but do not come out of the dryer that way. Could try using the wrinkle setting on your dryer if you have that and if you care about how they look. I mostly only care about how they feel and that is smooth and crisp yet soft. The neutral color works well with any color scheme you may already have. The fitted sheet fits up to 20" mattresses, mine is about 16" or 17", so the heavy duty elastic band helps hold it snug on shorter mattresses. These seem very nice and I highly recommend.,5.0,1
Just purchased the Hotel Style 600 Thread Count Sheet Set- King size. I like how it has deep sides, so it fits my mattress. The pattern and the look of the sheets are very impressive. 
HOWEVER,  the feel of the material is not soft. To the touch, it feels smooth, almost silky, but even when washed correctly,  it almost sounds like plastic sheets and extremely noisy. My husband and I make jokes about this. The pillowcase are rough against my face and in the morning, it is like a beard burn next to my eye/cheeks area. Later in the day, it continues to hurts to the touch on my face. Because I spent close to $70, I was hoping for a more 'luxury' feel. My hope is after 100 washes, it will finally break down the fiber and become softer over time. Feeling disappointed.,3.0,1

Hotel Brand 600 Thread Count Sheet Set in Queen is so luxurious. I chose the color cream because is such an ease color to blend with other colors. It goes perfectly with the cream and peach comforter that I already have.The Queen set included a flat sheet (94" x 104"), fitted sheet (60" x 80") and pillowcases (21" x 32" each). However it also comes in a Full set which includes: flat sheet (86" x 96"), fitted (54" x 76") and pillowcases (21" x 32"). An a King set which includes: flat sheet (110" x 104"), fitted sheet (78" x 80") and pillowcases (21" x 40" each). I have brought Queen sheet sets before and had to struggle to get the fitted sheet to go on the bed and then to stay on the bed. However the fitted sheet that came with this set fits perfectly. Also this set is super soft because of the 100% Egyptian Cotton with Sateen weave its made out of. Its nothing worst than trying go to sleep on scratchy or coarse feeling sheets. Also this sheet set is machine washable which is great an cost effective. These sheets offer great quality,awesome feel and fit. This is my new favorite sheet set.,4.0,1

We installed this light to replace an old flourescent fixture in our medium-sized kitchen. It provides great lighting and really makes the granite countertops stand out. My husband installed it without much difficulty, the only time consuming part of the installation was getting the light bulbs in place (the included suction cup holder was a big help with tightening the bulbs into place).,4.0,1

I have been looking for a chess table for some time. The options I saw were all very cheap or very expensive. This was a mid-range table and it is good for the price. The pros: the table is solid and well styled. It looks good in a living room. The styling of the legs is particularly elegant. The cons: one little design flaw is that the dark brown squares are the exact same color as the dark color of the tabletop-- the piece would look a little richer if there were a boarder around the table to separate the dark edge squares of the chess board from the table top. The other con is that the drawer bottom is really flimsy thin wood and the plastic drawer stop is visible beneath the front of the drawer. The manufacturer seems to have cheaped out a bit on the drawer. I reinforced mine by adding another piece of wood under the drawer. Also, the table is made in China and quality control on my table was spotty. It had a few screw holes barely visible on the inside of the drawer frame where someone had tried, and failed, three times to attach the drawer stop. I had to get one of those stain colored markers to fix the spots where the raw wood was exposed. Not a huge deal but not something one should have to do. I was offered an exchange but was told that due to back orders I would not get the replacement table for three months so I declined. One last important comment: the board is positioned on the table so that the players sit on the sides of the table with the drawer in front. That makes perfect sense if you position this between two chairs. Many of the fancier tables are set up so that the drawer is in front of one player when you are playing. That would not really work in my living room and is one of the biggest reasons I bought this table. Overall, it's a good purchase given the price.,3.0,1

I purchased a queen-size set of this brand yesterday (Hotel Style - Sateen weave - 600TC).  I washed all 4 pieces this morning.  Everything looked fine until I tried to fold the pillow cases.  One of them was cut or sewn crooked.  It would not flatten out.  When I put it on the pillow, I made the corners line up with the corners of the pillow but the seam wound its way from the edge and across the face of the pillow.  It's like the case was twisted.  If this had been sold as "seconds" at half price or something, I would have been ok with it but I paid full price.  I exchanged that set for another.  I'm hoping this new sheet set has no similar issues after going through the laundry.,3.0,1
I bought this offline. When I finally received it at the store and took it home it was obvious that this had been returned elsewhere. It was all banged up, its cheap "Woodgrain" was peeled off, the holes you screw screws into were bored out you couldn't use them. This is just horrible. I wouldn't reccomend this product and I wouldn't reccomend buying offline either if they are going to take defective products and sell them online. I got a TV offline from Wal-Mart as well it had to go back last week because it was defective AND it didn't even have its stand when it came to me.

This is just a great product!. I have to laugh at some of the silly, negative reviews on this machine. Every problem that I read in the reviews has a simple solution. For instance, you can use a My K-Cup Filter and use whatever kind of coffee you want. Read several reviews saying how "selfish" Keurig is and how limited you are on how you can brew coffee. Just not true! Read that you can't brew 10 ounce cups with K-Cups. Again, not true. You can brew 4,6,8, and 10 ounce cups with K-Cups. As for old K-Cups people are complaining about, the only ones that don't work are K-Cups from 2014!! If you have K-Cups that old, it's time to throw them away anyway. This K200 can do anything that an old machine can do and do it so much better with much more freedom, ease, and variety. This is my second Keurig coffee maker. My first one was the Office Pro from 2011. Loved, loved, loved that machine. It still works great and gave it to a friend when I got my K200 2.0. The K200 makes so many improvements and is so much easier to clean as well. I love how quiet the new machine is and love the water filter too. Pick up any of the new 2.0 machines and you won't be disappointed. You'll get a good, cup, mug or carafe every time. Have some friends that have the K500 and they absolutely prefer there new machine from their old Keurig machine. Really wanted the K500 model as well but this K200 just fits my limited counter space so much better. I really love Keurig and can't even imagine going back to a regular coffee maker. So happy with my purchase and I hope that this K200 brings me the many, many, many days of great coffee and beverages like my Office Pro did for 5 years. Thank you Keurig!!!!,5.0,1

This hose is made of the poorest quality tubing. If it was made with a better tubing and connector to hold tubing it would be a great product.  I used 2x and the tube swelled and busted while I was spraying garden with it.  The tubing swelled right at the nozzle end like a big balloon and then burst!  The material around the tubing is also a cheap sewn product which does not hold the tubing in place. It ripped with the swelling of the tube.  I can't judge DrHotDeal at this time due to waiting to hear back from them with an RA#.,1.0,1

Saw this at the store a month before Thanksgiving and thought this would not only replace a very old but much loved, 12 year old deep fat fryer, but the rotisserie and steamer was/is a plus.  Set it up with a 12.08 pound turkey, seasoned as recommended, cooked for the 1 hr., ten minutes and all temperatures were good.  Carved it up and set it out in a buffet line for the family.  After all were served, had one slice of white meat left for me, with everyone claiming it was great.  All I know it was so easy to setup, use with worries about turkey fryers indoors.  Followed the instructions explicitly and the experience was great, no boil over at all.  Also have used it as a French fry session. Heat was very stable and responded well.  Thanks Cuisinart for a great design.,5.0,1

I don't want to rate this bed poorly, because I don't think it's a bad bed. With that being said, don't get this bed if you're looking for something more on the firm side. I found this bed to be more soft and you will kind of sink into it. Not bad if you like that sort of bed. I gave it 3 stars because it is a good bed, just not for me, I just purchased it a month ago so I can't speak on how long it will last.,3.0,1
Our Caravan Valencia bench arrived promptly. My husband put it together with no problems, however when I arrived home I realized that tag, paperwork & box all stated "Steel Frame" i was very surprised as I was sure I had read that it had an "Aluminum Frame". Which was why I had ordered it. I called Hayneedle & they called the manufacturer to check. It turns out that the description was WRONG. So if you want Aluminum don't purchase this bench. But if steel frame is o.k. with you, go ahead and get it as it is really beautiful & two adults fit on it comfortably.,4.0,1

Well I have always wanted to try 600 thread count sheets so I ordered the Hotel Style Qweens 600 thread count sheet set. They are 100 % Egyptian Cotton with sateen Weave. They are Optimist Technology which means they fit mistresses up to 20 inches deep. I have a pillow top queen size bed so I thought these would fit well and they do fit well. They actually stretch! The set comes with 94 in x 104 in flat sheet a 60 inch x 80 inch fitted sheet, two standard Qweens pillowcases. They machine wash as directed. These are the softest sheets I have. Very silk like without being to slippery. I will let my friends and family now how great they are. I'm glad I chose them. Oh I forgot they are a very good value and good quality. They have a lovely embroidery on them. I will be purchasing more sets of these sheets. They are great,5.0,1
This waffle maker is outstanding! It has a sleek yet compact design (by Belgian waffle maker standards), heats quickly, is TRULY nonstick. My waffle come out perfectly.  First, I wiped down the unit as instructed, and plugged it in. I chose a "3" on the shade selector which is right down the middle. As I was getting together my batter, the blue light turned on, which means it is ready to cook. It comes with a handy dandy measuring cup so you can measure out  just the right amount of batter. The instructions do state that you cannot use nonstick cooking spray on the waffle iron, so I just poured in the batter and closed the lid. The blue light turns off, then back on to let you know it's done!  My waffle turned out perfect. Just the right amount of doneness for my liking and it cooked in about 2 minutes! The waffle came out of the iron so easy - it truly is nonstick. If you like waffles, this waffle maker is a must!,5.0,-1
It was really hard to find backless bar stools of this height to match other bar stools we'd purchased from another company, but these are almost a perfect match. For that, I'm very glad! The only reason I am not giving these a higher rating is because one of the two stools I received had been previously opened, I'm assuming a RETURN from someone else, because the seat has some marks on it that won't come off - I even tried baking soda, but it is still there. I will next try white shoe polish and hope it covers. They are comfortable and stylish, but because I received an already opened package, there were screws and washers missing, and there were no directions enclosed. They are not complicated to assemble, but that was an annoyance. I've never purchased from Hayneedle before, and the price was very reasonable for the two stools, but I do feel like I got the discount version of the deal. I got someone else's return. It was obvious by the condition of the box, which was all taped up with clear plastic tape, and distressed. That item should have been pulled from the inventory - not shipped to another customer - ME. Some of the nail-head studs are a bit skewed...again, another quality issue that is less than desirable. In conclusion, I will say the transaction was easy and the shipping was quick, but I do think quality control should be more carefully supervised. I would probably not purchase from them again, based on this experience. One of the bar stools was obviously new and unopened - the other was obviously previously opened and flawed.,3.0,1

I received this mattress free of charge in exchange for my honest review of the product. Here's what I thought about it.

I haven't had a good mattress with any support in over 10 years, so it took me two weeks to really get a good feel for this one. My old mattress was a traditional inner-spring that had lost ALL its support. I've been suffering with back pain for years because of this and would toss and turn most of the night. The 1st night was rough, I couldn't get comfortable and that was to be expected since my spine wasn't used to being supported. The 2nd night, I slept like a baby. Literally, I laid across the bed to watch TV at 8:00 pm and woke up the next morning at 8:45 am. It's been like that ever since.

I've slept on pillow top mattresses before and never liked them because you'd wake up in a deep hole sweating like a hog because they'd retain heat and wrap a cocoon of padding around you. Not this one. The Cool Gel Memory Foam REALLY works! I never roll over into hot spots, the mattress stays cool and doesn't give you the feeling of having to try to climb out of a grave in the middle of the night if you decide to turn over. I like how it supports you, without allowing you to sink too far into the mattress. It's firm enough to offer support and also soft enough to carry you off to dreamland. I LOVE THIS MATTRESS!!! I am so glad I got it. I've been waking up refreshed and not feeling like the walking dead every morning the way I did with my old mattress.

You'll have to excuse my excitement in the video I attached. The mattress came in a box, rolled up like carpet and as flat as a pancake. Since they only allow you to attach one video, I'm pasting the link to the video I made of unrolling the mattress out of the box: https://youtu.be/cgd8_NyTNC0
Once we broke the seal on the bag, it was like watching a time-lapsed video of a cake rising in the oven. It was amazing! I don't know what kind of vacuum sealer type equipment they used to get it that flat, but whatever it was is ingenious! The mattress just kept growing over-night. So it wasn't until the next day that it was fully inflated and boy was it HUGE! If you're looking for a mattress and want support, comfort and a pretty nice looking product, I would highly recommend this model by Modern Sleep.,5.0,1

Loved the design. Loved the color. Loved the delicious coffee it brewed. There was a problem, however, and after 3 days of dealing with it, I had to take it back and exchange it for a Keurig Classic machine. I had owned a Classic and it gave me dependable service for about 3 1/2 years. I should have stuck with that model. With this new model, it seems about every 3rd or 4th cup we brewed, we not only got a cup of coffee, but we got a cup full of grounds spilling over from the K-Cup into our coffee. This was a brand new machine, and we read and followed the instruction booklet to the letter. We did not overfill the water tank. We tried securely placing the K-Cup into the holder, and we also tried just loosely placing the cup in the holder. Made no diference. We also used fresh filtered water. With each mishap, I disassembled and rinsed the cup holder, then ran a cleansing brew of plain water to make sure all grains were cleared. It never failed to happen again at some point, and after 3 frustrating mornings of dealing with it, I gave up and exchanged it out for the classic. I am hoping for a much better performance tomorrow morning.,1.0,1
I was a little apprehensive about buying furniture off the internet but when I went to pick this chair up at my Walmart store, they opened the box for me and I fell in love with it.

The Hotel Brand 600 Thread Count 4 Piece Sheet Set is absolutely fabulous! I was quite smitten with these because I have slept on many sheets in my time, and was happy. Then...along came these. Now, I know what people mean when they say a higher thread count really does matter. I've always slept on the 300's, but never higher. However, since being given the opportunity to try these sheets out and review them honestly, here's my true opinion. #1, They wash up really well. #2 They dry wonderfully, and did not wrinkle(did not give them a chance to because right out of the dryer they went directly on my bed). #3 The Fitted Sheet has a deep pocket with a fitted seam that keeps the sheet from slipping, and makes it fit like a dream on my European pillow top mattress. #4 The material is a Sateen weave for a superior sleep experience. I love everything about these sheets, and will be purchasing another set. So glad Walmart is able to offer such wonderful products at a great price point. I highly recommend this set.,5.0,1

I've been using Keurigs since the first one hit the market all those years ago. After several years of only using the one at my parent's or at the office, I decided to get myself the turquoise K200 series to match all my kitchen decor. Love the color! It's not as compact at I had hoped, it takes up the same amount of space as my parent's older Keurig does, so that makes the amount of usable counter space I have in my small kitchen a bit of an issue. I was surprised by how noisy this unit is as the large commercial unit we have at my office is really quiet, as is the one my parent's have. Since I've not had mine for long, I can't speak of its longevity, but I can bet it'll give me a few years worth of brews. Overall, I'm very please with my purchase!,4.0,1

I BOUGHT THIS TO REPLACE MY HOME COFFE MAKER (HAMILTON BEECH), THAT MADE LOUSY COFFEE. I HAVE A KEURIG 1.0 IN MY OFFICE THAT USES A REFILLABLE K-CUP W/ AN ADAPTER. THE NEW UNIT (2.0) WILL ONLY WORK W/ KEURIG K-CUPS AND KEURIG DOES NOT MAKE A REFILLABLE K-CUP FOR THE 2.0 SYSTEM AT THIS TIME. I RESOVED ALL PROBLEMS BY PEELING OFF A FRESHLEY BREWED KEURIG K-CUP TOP ( THE HEAT RELEASED THE GLUE ON THE CUP TOP) AND PLACED IT PRINTED SIDE UP ON PAKING TAPE (STICKY SIDE UP) THEN TAPED THAT TAPE WITH PRINTED SIDE UP TO MY REFILLABLE TOP. I THEN INSERTED THE REFILLABLE K-CUP IN THE THE 2.0 UNIT, CLOSED THE TOP, THEN OPENED THE UNIT AND PRESSED THE EXPOSED TAPE ON TO THE EXPOSED BOTTOM OF LID (CLOSING MECHINISM). IT WOKED FINE BUT DID NOT HAVE THE FULL MENU.!!!! TO FIX THAT, I USED A SMALL 1/32 SCALE SLOT CAR MAGNET AND PLACED IT ON THE BOTTOM EDGE OF THE K-CUP INSERT HOLDER. IT HOLDS MAGNETICALLY IN A VERTICLE POSITION AUTOMACTICALLY. VIOLA!!!!!! I NOW HAVE FULL MENU AND CARAFE CAPABILITY AND AM USING MY AFTER MARKET REFILLABLE K-CUP!!! SHAME ON YOU KEURIG!!!!!!!! FOR GETTING GREEDY ABOUT YOUR COFFEE SALES!!! TO RE-DESIGN A QUALITY COFFEE MAKER THAT WILL NOT ALLOW THE CUSTOMER TO USE THE COFFEE OF HIS CHOICE IS UNCONSCIENABLE AND DOWN RIGHT WRONG!!!!

Like so many other Keurigs, mine worked for a few months, then started only pumping a fraction of a cup. Did all the usual things that customer service suggests...ran cleaner through it multiple times, cleaned the needle (which wasn't plugged), etc. It finally stopped working altogether. Called Keurig and was told they would send me a new brewer...at a small discount. No thanks. The problem with a Keurig is the pump. It malfunctions. So for all those who post reviews like "I love it!", come back in a few months and let us know if you still love it. That's the problem with most reviewers. they don't wait and see how long the product lasts.,1.0,1

I absolutely love this waffle maker! The things I like most about it is the dial to select the wellness you want your waffle to be (I found 3 to be perfect for me) also the overflow ring around the edge so any extra batter doesn't come out the sides and if any gets in there it cooks that as well. There is a light to let you know when it's ready to cook and another to let you know when it's ready to take out. It does make decent size waffles too. I would definitely recommend this.,5.0,-1
Product arrived quickly. I washed them in warm water and dried on the regular setting and they fit really well.

Although these are thin, they are so so soft.  I purchased the brown and they washed perfectly and did not fade( SN's did).  They stay in place and tucked even when the bed is adjusted.  I would buy these again.  They are a great deal.,5.0,-1

My apartment came with an older version of a GE microwave that needed replacement after many years of usage. I bought this one because the experience is similar to my older unit.

They work. They are a lot thinner and the quality is not as good as the more expensive bamboo sheets. And a corner of the fitted sheet was coming apart and I had to resew it. But, they are very soft, and they work like bamboo sheets should. So for the price I would say they are a decent buy if you want bamboo sheets but can't afford them.,3.0,1

Brewer clogs and/or makes excessively large puncture in pod spilling grounds. This happens often - even right after a thorough cleaning. This is my fifth Keurig brewer but the first to present any kind of problem (and it's a replacement for my first B250 brewer that had similar but worse problems. Could there be a design fault in the pod handling mechanism?,3.0,1
The removable grids make this the most convenient and easiest to clean grill I have ever used - and I've been through several of them over the years. It heats up quickly and cooks evenly and timely.

my chair was delivered on time. I put it together and it just doesn't feel quite as substantial as I expected. the back felt wobbly after i attached it but my husband tightened it down. I have not sat on it much so I am not sure yet of my long-term opinion. Not sure how the little fabric flaps at the back, against the seat where it attaches to the back, are supposed to be tucked in. Not exactly disappointed in this chair, but not impressed either. For $99 maybe it's what i should expect.,3.0,1

I usually do not read reviews...not ever, but since getting the larger 2.0 & realizing I could not use the filter to enjoy my own favorite coffee ( although that has recently changed), I now understand the importance of reading reviews. I was going to purchase the 2.0/200 for weekday use, only to find out I can't use my ole pods....that really sticks....... Shame on you Keurig!!!!!.......from a faithful customer who has owned your brewer since the very first one. With each new brewer comes new disappointments. Instead of improving the brewers, Keurig just seems to come up ways to stick it to the consumer. I do believe it's probably time to change over to another brewing system by another company........because I refuse to stop drinking coffee!!!!!,1.0,1

I have washed these sheets several times before review. I wash them and if placed immediately on bed the sheets look like they were ironed. When changing the bedding, I place the folded set into the dryer and just like they were new again. I have a matttress that is very thick, plus two down comforterers on top of that. The sheets fit. The pillowcases also fit into standard size pillows, but my pillows are very fluffy. I ordered two and am very happy with this bedding. Highly recommend to people who like very soft, durable bedding.,5.0,1
I genuinely love this product, not only is it way better than any other coffee maker or tea kettle, it's beautiful looking. It has a touch screen and step by step display. Also, you can program it to have a cup or carafe of your favorite coffee or tea waiting on you in the morning, afternoon, or evening. But you can also tell it it what kind of brew you want. It gives an option for a "strong brew", for those of you that like coffee that feels like a good morning slap in the face. What makes it special is, it's just so incredibly easy to you. It has a detachable water dispenser, so you doing have to play, try not to get a electrocuted. But it's good for any household, because each individual person, can have their favorite cup of coffee in under 3 minutes. It's good for someone on the go, or someone who likes to have their beverages at their leisure. But with an, 'on the go' brewing speed. I've always wanted one, I've always wondered if it was all it was cracked up to be? It totally is. Why spend close to the same amount on something basic, when you can have something special. Keurig 2.0 is definitely special. And now that I use the K-Pods, I do see them in more and more grocery stores. So you don't HAVE to order everything online, but you can if you wanted to.,5.0,1

I was very disappointed when this grill arrived. I had read in the stats that it was 9"x12". When it actually has a cooking surface that is 8"x8". I guess it was my mistake for not noticing that it is listed as being 60 sq. inches. I should have done the math. Anyway, I guess I'll start searching for a larger model once I find out that it actually does what it's supposed to do.,3.0,1
I have what I call overstuffed leather furniture. I was a little nervous about the covers working with my furniture, but I have dogs, and was willing to take the chance.

I am a late bloomer as a coffee drinker and only drink "specialty" type drinks. Took me 5 years trying to talk myself into buying a Keurig. I finally did it last October. WoW...am I ever glad I dd. I use it for hot coffee drinks, iced tea (brewed with hot water), cocoa, soups, instant hot cereals. I have just ordered another one to put into my RV when we set it up as a home away from home. It is WoNdErFuL!!! The only thing that is bother is that I run my water through a Britta before putting it into the Keurig. Probably overdoing it...but I haven't had any problems for 4 months of constant use.,5.0,1
I bought 10 packs of the 95" curtains in white after reading many reviews. Most of what I had seen had to do with colors, so I didn't worry about the white. They came in quickly, and I opened the first two packages and hung them. After stepping back I noticed two things - None of the 4 panels were the same length (and I mean 1-3" variance on every one), and none of them were 95" long. I already had 95" designer curtains up, so I knew they were accurate. These curtains were hanging behind to provide just a little privacy during the day when the big curtains were open.  If the bottom of the curtains were hidden, I wouldn't worry as much, but mine are not going to be hidden behind furniture. Very disappointed in the quality. Also, there was no packing slip included in the package, and none of the packages were barcoded, much less have the brand name on them. They all came in clear packages that said 2x95 and that was it. We'll see how trying to return these goes.,1.0,1

You must always shut the water off at the source. If you don't the water will fill up too much in the hose and the hose will bust open and no good to use.

I was told the item would arrive on 10/23, then 10/24, oh wait, it will arrive on 10/26. It's 10/27 and I just received what I can only describe as a child's chair. It was to serve as an accent chair to the small spaces sectional I had just ordered. It ended up being a ridiculous waste of money. I'm returning it this evening. The fabric is good quality, and assembly was a breeze. Those are the only positive things I can write about this chair.,1.0,1

I received this machine as a gift and while it worked just fine I actually upgraded to the 450. It worked well, but was too small for my needs. In a two adult household it seemed like I was refilling the reservoir every day. The reservoir being on the back was a bit cumbersome with the machine being on my kitchen counter underneath cabinets. I had to pull it out and refill the reservoir each time. The motor was also very loud. I called keurig support and they said that over time it would get quieter, but this was just not good for me. It still brewed just fine and the coffee was good. I'd still recommend to a friend because I do believe that it would work great for someone in a college dorm or military barracks who wants a good cup of coffee without sacrificing on what little counter space you have.,4.0,1

For $65.oo I think a person would expect something really good right out of the package, however these sheets were so wrinkled I almost stuffed them back in the pk.  They were hard for me to get on the bed alone, they kept squirting back off due to being so tight with elasticity.   I do like that part as they stay on the bed and won't pull off.  They are not soft so don't expect that but they are what I wanted which is a sheet that won't get wrapped  up and trip you when you are trying to get out of the bed.  They are a thick material that gives the feeling of a starched sheet. They were much better after being washed with some softener, but still wrinkle easily.,2.0,1
I looked for a while to find a cover for the love seat that my dogs love to sleep on. I had my list on requirements as to fabric and ability to stay tucked in, this cover has it all.  The arms and back are extra long and there are straps to hold it all down. I also purchased the Slip Cover Tuck Grips. This cover has panels that tuck down very well but I opened the end of each and inserted the Tuck grip. I fitted and used the straps to secure and tucked it in as far as I could. Wow! The picture is of the cover 5 days later. My two large dogs did not get it untucked. These 2 item together are the right combo.,5.0,1

I purchased this for my boyfriend for christmas. I've used my mom's keurig (another older model) and loved it. She used her own coffee rather than the pods and it always tasted perfect. I purchased the my kcup and carafe to go along with the brewer. Unfortunately no matter what I've tried I can't manage to get a strong cup of coffee out of the my kcup. I can't speak for the regular pods as we haven't used these and never intended to. Is there a trick I don't know about? I've searched the internet and discovered many other people have had the same issue. It's a real bummer and I guess I'm just going to have to give in and buy regular pods. Its a shame. I really want to have the freedom to use whatever coffee I want. My sister got us some specialty coffee from a roaster in dallas and I can't even get a proper brew from it. It literally looks like tea no matter what I do. I've adjusted the grind and made sure not to over pack the filter. Nothing works. Just be warned if you were thinking of using this for your own coffee. You will be very disappointed.,2.0,1

The sheets are soft and comfortable, but they also seem cheaply made.....there are already snags after one washing (and no sleeping!). Also - the color is orange. I know orange is a bright color, but holy mackerel - the brightness almost shines through my closed eyes! I was hoping for something a bit more "peachy" than neon.  I can't help but compare these sheets to the last set of sheets I bought from a different manufacturer. The earlier purchased sheets are soft and comfortable, but they are also very well made, and sturdy. They've been washed multiple times, and still feel like new. I don't feel confident about these new, orange sheets holding up as well.,3.0,1
This cover is fairly well made, substantial thickness, looks nice. The tan color is darker than shown but still O.K. HOWEVER, the fit is terrible. Unless the seat width is exactly 45" (inside arm to inside arm) it does not fit as shown in the picture. The OVERALL length of my loveseat is 65", and the seat portion of this cover is at least 9" too short on each end. The arm covers are very long and drag on the floor by a few inches even when tucked in at the end of the seat. The strap which is supposed to attach the back part of the cover to the arm piece to hold it in place is not long enough, as several other customers have mentioned.,3.0,1
While this product did take a little longer than I would've preferred for it to arrive, it was well worth the wait. This is a beautiful, option for a window covering. Much nicer than the standard, inexpensive vinyl miniblinds that I had before. It was relatively easy to install. The size that I purchased was definitely a two-person job. I love how these blinds give you the option to easily customize how much light filters through them with just the gentle tug of the bottom of the blind. I am very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend it to anyone looking for something classier and upgraded from a standard vinyl miniblind.,5.0,-1

This is, without any doubt the most expensive way to waste your money. I drink no more than 3 cups a day and this thing has been failing to work as advertised since month 2. My personal favorite is the completely white screen that doesn't allow you to do ANYTHING., and Keurig's helpful response? Please unplug and "hopefully that will solve the problem" and the good news is that it does for about 3 cups of coffee. Oh, and sometimes even unplugging it does not work. On top of that, the reliability of the machine is about 20%, each day is a new adventure on what won't work on this machine. Some days it takes (no exaggeration) 20minutes to "preheat" , and at least once a week it won't produce a full cup of coffee (no matter how often or well you use their little unclogger thing). Add to this you can't use any pods except those made by/for Keurig and that you can't dispense more than 6 oz of hot water at a time (go hang, tea drinkers!) and that the water filter required is an extra 20 bucks, and what you have is an overpriced trashcan ornament. Keruig, complete fail. I'll be taking my business elsewhere. Between the lousy equipment and your lackluster"customer service" I'll never purchase a Keurig product again. Happy New Year to me. *Note: I'd have used stronger language about my disgust for the machine and Keurig's customer service, but the site won't even allow it. Have no doubt, this is the worst piece of equipment I've run across. Don't waste your time, money and save keep your hair in your head where it belongs.,1.0,1
The packaging states that these cushions are 3.5" thick. They are not. The ones I received were less than 3" thick, just a shade over 2.5" thick. We tried them; after 10 minutes of sitting, we decided to return them. The pattern/color was great, but the ones I received were not as described.,1.0,1

For the price, this rug is decent. The pile is a good length, thick enough and fairly cushy. It exceeded my expectations in that aspect.
However, I purchased it together with a 5x8 rug pad of the same brand and the rug is smaller than the rug pad on all sides by about an inch all the way around.
Also, one corner of the rug came misshapen. Its not a bend or a crease, but the actual shape has a small crescent dip in it. It's too much of a hassle to return the rug and see if the next one is the right shape and size.

I owned 2 of these racks previously and they needed replacing after several years of use and leaving them outside on a balcony (The mesh disintegrated and some of the rails rusted -- my fault for leaving them in the rain!) I decided to go with the same rack design after a quick internet search and not finding a different one that pleased me. I couldn't find one in my local stores, so I ordered this on-line. It's great because it expands really wide and you can lay clothes on the mesh across the top. Also folds down neatly for storage. I'll try not to leave this one in the rain!,4.0,1

Washed it once in COLD water on GENTLE CYCLE prior to putting it on my bed. I did dry it but just until it was dry. Put it on my bed and surprised that it was too small. Measured it and it is 82 X 79 and not 104 x 90. How on earth did this happen? There is no way this was king sized. I must have been shipped the wrong size, possibly their Full/Queen size. Very disappointed because I wanted KING SIZE and paid for king size. VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED. IT IS TOO SMALL FOR MY BED.,2.0,1
I used to like coffee but I decided to get a kerig machine because my husband doesn't drink coffee and I thought a regular coffee maker just seemed to waste the coffee (can't just make 1 cup). But now I am TOTALLY ADDICTED TO COFFEE! my family tried an intervention and send me to rehab but it was no use. There are so many delicious flavors to try and in my opinion it's better than coffee house coffee. If you switch to this coffee maker, just be aware you will not be able to drink coffee out of a regular machine ever again. This particular machine is great coz it has never jammed which a plus when u are shaking bad for a fix at 5:30am.,5.0,1

The system offers the ability to brew a 4, 6, 8, or 10 ounce cup. If choose 10 ounce and the majority of the time get 4 ounces. I choose 4 ounces and get anywhere from 2 to 10 ounces all at once.

I purchased the K200 for my office. It's small size fits well on my desk. I prefer this to the Mini Keurig I had previously. This machine has a water tank and with the old machine I had to premeasure the ounces of water. I like the fun colors this machine is available in. I think it makes a great cup of coffee but I find it a tad less hot than my Mini brewer. I do think that the knock off K-cups will have a plastic taste but if you stick to real branded K cups there is no problem.,4.0,1

I bought this coffee maker on Black Friday a few years ago.  I use it rarely as it was purchased for my office.  When my Keurig at home broke (I'd had it for years) I took the K250 home.

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] A really nice stool for the money. Actually you can't beat the price! But I bought these because I wanted a light tan linen fabric stool.

None of these hoses - and I have purchased 4 of them - can handle the pressure of a city water supply.

For anyone who has bought more expensive sheets, you know they will be stiff and a little rough. As with any pricey sheet set, the more you wash them the better they get over time.

I've been looking for these kind sheets for a long time and I will be buying more of these 600 Hotel Style sheets again. They are an excellent product!,5.0,1

I've been using a multi-cup coffeemaker for years, and could never bring myself to splurge on a Keurig since I'm the only one who drinks coffee in our house. After trying the Keurig K250*, I'd be lying if I said that I could ever see myself going back to my old coffeemaker! PROS: This has been so easy to use. The machine heats up quickly and makes a nice HOT cup of coffee. My old maker didn't even spit out coffee this hot, so it's nice to get coffee at the temperature it should be. Since I started using the Keurig, I've also learned that I've never made a proper cup of coffee. I would sleepily stumble to my coffeemaker, dump a little coffee in the filter and turn it on. Then, I'd dump half a cup of creamer into it just to cover up the flavor, which was different every time. I love that the Keurig takes the guess out of measuring. I get a great tasting cup of coffee every time. I've even discovered that I LOVE my coffee without creamer. French Roasts and Hazelnuts not only smell great, but they taste divine now too! I can get a few days of use out of the machine before it reminds me that I need to add more water. It's a little annoying, but with my old maker, I had to fill it every day, so that's just me being lazy. haha CONS: No, major cons. I didn't really find too much that I didn't like about the machine. It is a little noisy. Nothing super loud, but louder than my old maker and I do worry that it will wake up the kiddo if I'm trying to brew a cup during naptime since their bedroom is right off the kitchen. It was a lot bigger than my old machine and does take up a good amount of space in our tiny apartment kitchen. It's not the largest machine in the world, but I'm not sure if I would recommend it for apartment/dorm living or for anyone who had little counter space. I wish it had a clock/timer function like my old maker, but that's nothing that would keep me from purchasing this machine. It is true that this machine can ONLY use the 2.0 K-cups with the special white ring on them. There are plenty of ways around this, but the simplest solution is just to buy a 2.0 reusable k-cup. They're easily accessible for purchase in most stores. I picked one up and have been using it for weeks, without issue, in my K250 2.0 brewer. Overall, I'm very glad that I got the chance to try this machine out for myself. The pros definitely outweigh the cons, and I would recommend this machine.

I ordered this shag rug in Rivera Blue. The color is much darker than shown. The description says it has a non-slip backing, but it doesn't. I would have to purchase a rubber mat to put underneath it to protect my hardwood floor.

Hotel Style Queen 600 Thread Count Sheet Set
100% Egyptian Cotton with Sateen Weave

Out of the box the Hotel Style Queen 600 Thread Count Sheet Set 100% Egyptian Cotton with Sateen Weave was soft and very shinny. The Sheet Set advertised to have Optifit Technology which means the fitted sheet fits mattresses up to 20 inch deep. My bed is exactly 20 inches deep and I had a difficult time placing the fitted sheet on the mattress and I had to get help to place the fitted sheet on my mattress. I was so overjoyed to discover that the pillow cases were generous in size also that I could place two standard pillows in one pillow case. When the bed was made up it did look very pretty but living in the northeast the temperature was quite cold around 17 degrees and although my bedroom was warm, when I laid between the sheets I felt cold and slippery which was not too pleasing to me. I immediately took the sheet set off and replaced it with my warm inviting flannel sheet set. I washed and dried the 100% Egyptian Cotton with Sateen Weave sheet set and found pilling on the sheet set and it wrinkled a lot.

I wanted to be fair with this review so I ironed the sheets and placed the sheet set on a bed in my Guest Room. This mattress is approximately 18 inches deep and was easy to place on the mattress without help. The bed did look clean and crisp and ready for my Nephews overnight visit. My Nephew informed that he found the sheet set soft and inviting, but cool to the touch. He did advise me that it might be better if I would use this sheet set in the summer months which might help to keep the bed cool, which I do agree with my Nephew’s suggestion.,3.0,1

I am very satisfied so far with these sheets. I like the colors and I love the fact that each set comes with 4 pillow cases instead of only two. I have washed one set three time so far and they still look brand new. They are comfortable and soft and they are also thick. This is a great deal for only $40.

Have yet to test this in the Field but I'm impressed with the look and feel. Very nice sheath as well. I give this 4 stars because I haven't tested it outdoors yet but it's very sharp right out of the package. As far as a rating for service ( shipping process from Walmart) I rate it in the negative.

First I am not one to review things I purchase, but I had to with this bed. I bought it for my daughter in a full size. I am so impressed. It is beautiful. It arrived earlier than we expected and this bed is worth it! I have seen probably others more well made but with 3 times the price. We also didn't have any problem putting it together at all. It took a couple hours because we did it carefully. It is definitely a little effort to get together but WOW! I wish the bed were mine! The charcoal linen fabric and silver nail heads look so classy. And we had all the pieces and everything seemed to line up very well. I was nervous to spend so much, not seeing it in person. It is made upon ordering. But I am so happy I did. I hope this review helps!,5.0,1
I bought this on sale so it was definitely worth the price! I got it on sale for 30 dollars! The specifications do not mention that this is for more of a chair recliner that doesn't rock or swivel. I got it to fit on my recliner that swivels and rocks by tucking the straps into random places but it looks a little funny from the back (which is fine since its near a wall). I gave it 4 stars overall because I didn't end up having to return it even though its a little odd fitting. I bought the yellow one which surprisingly covers the ugly flower pattern that was on the chair. I definitely think that they should mention in the specifications that it doesn't fit a rocking/swiveling recliner- someone else might not have as much patients as I do.,4.0,1

I ordered the ivory rug in February. So far I'd say my money hasn't been wasted. I'm not in love with the rug, but it does look nice. As others have said, it does smell funny. The smell dies down, but if you lay on it you can still smell mine (5 months later). Every time I vacuum it I feel like it's going to start ripping the shags out, but I've never owned a shag rug before so that could be normal. I also think it seems to be getting dirty very easily, though I live alone and never have people over. I did have to clean dirt off of it after it was delivered. That was annoying, but it came out easily. Scrubbing at it to get stains out seems to be very hard on the rug, and I've only scrubbed lightly. It does leave little crusty pieces everywhere from the underneath material. I would recommend this to others, especially if they're going with a color other than ivory. As a final note, I don't think it feels that soft. The material looks good, but feels cheap. When I sit on it, it hurts my skin, so I usually put a blanket under me. It feels ok to walk on.,4.0,1
Quite satisfied with this product. We needed a small microwave that could be mounted under the cabinet and this one fills the bill!,4.0,-1
Setting up my brewer wasn't as easy as I expected as I ran into an issue during it's initial setup - it took about 15 minutes and me turning the system off before it was ready. The instructions didn't exactly match the setup process that I noticed. I like how quiet the system seems to be, but there are two negatives I can think of: 1) I don't like how you have to use specific k-cup packs that teamed up with Keurig. As I try to transition to more organic coffees, I don't like being limited to what I can use. 2) For the price, I can't stand that it doesn't come with a carafe. And, of course, it supposedly only works with the Keurig Thermal Carafe for another $30 plus shipping. I love the convenience of Kuerig and there are many good basic brands of coffee available for the machine, but it's not as convenient as previous models in my opinion.,3.0,1
I use this every morning. It is so simple to use and brews quickly. It even heats up more quickly than it said it would. When I first got it, which was last week, it wouldn't brew a 10oz cup whn using a k-cup. Only 8oz would come out. However, I could get 10oz of hot water. I called and they quickly replaced the part that held the k-cups. It now brews 10oz with a k-cup, so I am very pleased. I couldn't ask anything more than this. I like having a bunch of choices since drinking the same thing over and over gets boring to me. Thanks Keuring!,5.0,1

These Hotel Brand 600 thread count sheets are very scratchy and not very soft. I was very excited to try these sheets thinking with the name Hotel Brand these would feel like expensive sheets at a fancy hotel and being such a large thread count they would be super soft, but they are not. Right out of the package they were very scratchy and did not feel soft at all. I washed them thinking they would soften up but they did not. I decided to wash them again and this time use fabric softener which I rarely use and these sheets felt exactly the same, rough. I put them on my bed and slept on them. It has been about four nights sleeping on these sheets and the longer I sleep on them the more I am getting used to them. But they still feel the same and they make warm and itchy. I do have sensitive skin every once in awhile and these sheets just do not give me a comfortable night sleep. I do like how deep the pockets are on the sheets and the elastic band on the fitted sheet is very thick and can with stand a lot of tug and pulling and washing and use. I am just disappointed in the thread count majorly. I also though the higher the thread count the softer the sheets. This is not the case with these sheets.,2.0,1

I was so surprised when I saw it because I was expecting a way bigger box! Once you unpack the mattress, you lay it flat, and CAREFULLY cut the plastic along the sides. You will then hear a loud hissing noise as the air is let into the mattress and it expands. I let the mattress “sit” without getting on it for 48 hours and it really did rise! It is a lot higher than my regular mattress but it is so worth it! I love the fact that it is firm yet the gel memory foam also makes it soft. The gel memory foam makes it so you feel cooler during the night by drawing the heat away from you as you sleep. I also love the fact that the side of the mattress has multiple little straps that you can hold onto so you can easily move it wherever you want. Bottom line…I would DEFINETLY buy this mattress!! It is a great investment and seems like it will last for years and years! Trust me, this is a purchase you will NOT regret!,5.0,1
The chairs are quite impressive for the price. They sit well and look very nice in our sanctuary. Everyone was impressed by them. We had a little trouble lining up the inked lines for the backs to be screwed on. Only because the ink was very close on one of the dye lots in comparison to the fabric color. We used clamps to hold the backs in place while putting in the screws and it worked great. All chairs were well packed and wrapped and customer service was great. We will order more in the future.,5.0,1

I wanted a toy box for my our Granddaughter to use at our house. This Captain's chest fit the bill perfectly. Her safety was the number one consideration. This chest has the safety hinge and the cut out area to keep her finger from getting mashed. The price was great. The size was perfect for where we wanted to place it. We opted for the unfinished so we could match the furniture color in the family room. We will be able to use this for storage long after the grandchildren will not longer need it. Made from solid pine, we know it durability.,5.0,-1

I was extremely impressed with the high quality of the fabric from the Hotel Brand . The stitching was beautiful. I hate making the bed because the corners are always hard to stretch over the mattress ,but this was truly easy! Each corner's made with elastic so it stretches to fit without any tugging or pulling so easy to do now! It fits mattresses up to 20 inches deep. I will be buying more of this Hotel Brand. I have a regular mattress this is made for deep mattress but works fine on the standard and fit the whole mattress I never had it cover it entirely I am so impressed . It is lovely to look at also because there is a nice shine to it. I can tell this material will last through many ,many washes.,5.0,1

Installed light in my kitchen and my wife loves it. Not difficult to install however a second pair of hands to hold the light while one person connects the wires is best. I would definitely recommend putting the shades and bulbs in before you hang it as they are a little difficult to put on. The light is bright, however each light only lights up a small area as they are more like spot lights.The light I replaced was a three light ceiling fan with three 60 watt bulbs and they more evenly lit up my kitchen. That being said,I would still buy again.,4.0,-1
Love Green Mountain coffee and miss my old Keurig machine after many years of service. New K 200 unfortunately makes very weak coffee [more like tea] Hope I can find a resolve,2.0,1

I want my old Keurig back. It's obvious this is Keurig's silly attempt to keep us from using our own grind of coffee and to force us to spend almost $1/pod for others. I have had 4 previous Keurig makers and cannot recommend this one to anyone. Back to my French press--more fun anyway.,1.0,1
We had the original Keurig and loved it until it finally died. We purchased the 2.0 and have been so disappointed. It feels like we've regressed instead of making it better. It's slower, takes forever to make a cup of coffee, then you only get 10 ounces! There's often grounds in the bottom of the cup. Overall, I'm just bummed that I don't have my old Keurig.,2.0,1
I got this as a gift for Christmas and I wish I hadn't. First off it does not work on non-Keurig pods. I got on their support line today and they said such a  notice was on the packaging. I have the packaging with me and I looked again at all six sides and there is no notice that non-Keurig branded pods will not work. So I took one of the Keurig pods that came with the machine and taping the top on my pods and it is working fine. Second the touch screen is something that works seldom. It was suggested that I unplug the unit to reset the screen. That's a great suggestion that I crawl under my desk to unplug it every time I want to use this product. Third, it only goes to 10 oz when I can get the screen to work. If i want the standard 12 oz size I have to spend even more money.,1.0,1

This is our second Keurig purchase. We loved our first Keurig and after it quit working we purchased the Keurig 2.0 without hesitation. Unfortunately, it has been a huge disappointment.

When it recognizes the pods, brews good tea/coffee... problem is IF.

The towels are good. They have enough fluff.
BUT! The Better Homes and Garden towel is a much better buy. The Martex are $10.00 per towel. I purchased the Better Homes and Garden Extra Absorbent at the same time for $4.93 per towel. The Martex color was more vibrant. The BH&G has a slight greyish tint. I liked the tint, it is a bit more sophisticated, and the towel is fluffier than the Martex.
The price difference between the two types makes the
Better Homes and Gardens Extra Absorbent Bath Towel Collection, a much much better buy.,1.0,1
I'm pretty pleased with my purchase. First the plastic Rattan looks very real. It almost has a real feeling of Rattan also. Its wound as though Rattan would be, so sometimes a "strand" of it blocks some of the holes for assembly. This is easily resolved just by moving it around or screwing part of an edge of it into a hole. The cushions really do repel water rater well, but I wouldn't leave them out in a heavy downpour. The glass on the table is tempered, with smoothed edges and corners and the suction cups are already attached to the table. It's made in Viet Nam and comes with pictorial instructions for assembly, all the washers and bolts you need, and an Allen wrench.  Two people (working well together) to greatly reduce assembly time. I was still able to put it all together by myself but felt like I'd just earned a Doctorate in Engineering when I was done.  It looks good.....but NOT as good as in the photo, simply because I don't have a vase of flowers and a pool for it to sit in front of. The free shipping is also great and should be factored in when considering. The chairs are not adjustable, but I'm 6'1" and 250 lbs. and can still sit fine in one, so only the largest of people need to check out the exact measurements before buying. Hopefully, this is a purchase that will bring me many summers of use.,4.0,1
The color is gorgeous and these are definitely the softest sheets I own! The fitted sheet seems a tiny bit loose, even on my pillow top mattress.

Got my Keurig 2.0 K250 as a gift and so far I like it and the many types of k-cups there are and will be trying. Only thing is how to power off?

"The FiberBuilt Umbrella is made right here in the U.S.A. and it certainly shows nothing but great workmanship from top to bottom.

Treat yourself to a great nights sleep with Hotel Style 600 thread count sheet sets. These luxurious sheet sets are soft cozy and help you get a good nights sleep. These sheet sets are created from pure Egyptian cotton, which makes them soft and breathable and beautiful to the touch Hotel Brand 600 thread count sheets offer Sateen weave for comfort and Optifit technology which provides a secure fit for mattresses from 9-20 inches deep. Stretch corners keep the fitted sheet smooth and flat while the extra wide elastic band around the edge of the sheet helps to keep it in place.
I really like these sheets because they are soft and cozy. So cozy in fact, that I didn't want to get out of bed in the morning. Hotel Brand 600 thread count sheets are 100% Egyptian cotton, are machine washable and come in many sizes styles and colors. I have only had them a few days, but the quality seems good and I think they will be long lasting sheets.

I was looking for an inexpensive area rug because my hardwood floor in my bedroom gets so cold in the winter. I ordered online and was a bit skeptical when the rug arrived because in the packaging it looked like a short loop more like a berber. When I opened the carpet and got it laid out onto my floor it fluffed up nicely and was exactly what I was looking for. I love the rich dark grey color and the shag feels nice under my bare feet.

This is my first time of using this type of hose. It is very compact and expands to 50' when  you connect the hose to water supply. It shrinks back to the original size when you close the valve and let the water in the pipe drain.  Nice design.  Hope it will last a couple of summers.,4.0,1
I have to admit, WalMart would have never entered my mind as a place to shop for a rug had it not popped up.  I am so happy it did as this is perfect for our application.  It is a soft cream color.  I have vacuumed it several times and no longer pick-up much carpet fiber or threads.  It has a very soft feel underneath our feet.  
The only negative I have is:  The rug initially stunk.  I'm not sure if it was the dye or the backing but,  I placed it outside in the sun (see photo), for a few hours  and  the odor was completely gone.,5.0,1

The Chefman Anti-Overflow Waffle Maker is a really nice product. I was definitely skeptical at first, I've use a few different waffle irons in the past and they always overflow. This Anti-Overflow Waffle maker heats up very quickly! I always make a test waffle for my first one of the batch, this waffle did overflow a tiny bit. After that first one, no more overflow! There is a nice little reservoir around the plates to catch the batter overflow. The waffles were easy to take off, the plates are nonstick! There's a dial for your preferred browning and a ready indicator light. They came out perfectly! The instruction manual also has Easy to follow recipes inside! (Which I did use) Another feature was the cup/scoop for the waffle batter, it has two fill lines on it. One for thicker waffles and one for thinner waffles. I have used this waffle maker 3 times so far and the only time it overflowed was the first one. I feel that this is a wonderful product and look forward to using it again.,4.0,-1

PROS: we use this griller up to 4 times a day in our household as a quick and easy way of making a fast lunch/dinner that still has that "grilled" look and taste but without all the fuss of starting the grill outside...the grilling surface is perfect for our needs.

the unit heats up in about 2 minutes, nice and fast, and it gets REALLY hot...so much so that the food sizzles when you place it on the heated grill, so be careful! i've also sprayed some olive oil on the grills before i turn it on, to flavor the food a bit, but be careful, as the grill heats up quickly and the olive oil will start to smoke a bit...

i can put on a raw boneless, skinless chicken breast about a half inch thick, season it on both sides and let it grill for about 5 minutes without having to turn it over and the chicken comes out completely cooked, grilled on both sides and is moist and juicy when you cut into it...it's perfect for our needs!

what i love most about it is that the grills pop out easily for quick cleanup. they are not heavy and bulky and clean easily. i do use soap and water though, because you can't clean the grill's surface by removing the grills until they have cooled down, so i let it cool and then remove the grills and soak then for about 5 minutes, then they come out looking brand new.

it's not a large unit, so you can leave it on your kitchen counter without it being in the way of other appliances or cooking surfaces.

CONS: there is no ON/OFF switch. the unit must be plugged in to work and unplugged when you are finished with it, so if you have individuals in your household that are absentminded and forget to unplug it after using, this could be a problem. i wish it had an "automatic shut off" design that might solve this issue.

i've also noticed that i can see some of the teflon or whatever the grill is coated with to make the black surface non-stick, seem to be wearing off a little, you can kind of see a little silver color appear in those spots, but only on the raised portions of the grill surface. i do not use metal utensils on the grill, i only use the plastic spatula type tool that comes with the grill. i think thats odd to be seeing that after only about 25 uses...but it still works great.

last con is the small spatula tool they give you..it is sooo tiny and flimsy that it's almost useless, but you can always use your own spatula, so i didn't think this was too much of a drawback.

all in all, i would definitely recommend this product. i had an older george foreman grill previously, but it didn't have the removable grills for easy cleaning and i wanted to upgrade to the new george foreman with the removable cleaning surface, but the price was prohibitive...this unit was only a little smaller than the george foreman i was looking at, and it was less than half the price.....it works great for me! if you are dieting like my husband and i are, it's a great purchase to get you in and out of the kitchen quickly and with very little mess...we've lost a total of 34 pounds in the last 3 weeks using this griller and plan on giving it a lot more use!,5.0,1

I got the keurig 2.0 k200 for Christmas since my older keurig wouldnt work anymore and I've hated this keurig since day 1! My coffee has all the coffee grounds in my cup every time! I called keurig for help and was told that it was the k-kups I was using (keurig brewed ones). So they gave me a code for 2 boxes of k- kups and I thought i would give it a try. I still end up with a whole cup of coffee with all the grounds in it. I've tried cleaning the machine with vinegar, using the silicone bulb to clean the needle and nothing has helped! No one wants to help fix the problem just blame it on other things. It seems these coffee makers are built for quantity NOT QUALITY anymore, very disappointed!!,1.0,1

I have two 10oz cups every morning at home. Sometimes more throughout the day. The great is it was cheap with the use of my points and it did brew a good cup of coffee for me. Whats not is my brewer acted up a few times and then died yesterday. 3 months is all i got. I did call customer service which was very helpful and are sending me a new brewer free of charge. I liked the Vue 550 brewer i had before this way better. For whatever reason there is nowhere near the variety of coffee which is why i switched to the Kcup. I hate the waste though. I liked being able to recycle my Vue pods after each use. Drop the Kcup and make all the flavors in the Vue pod. Vue Brewer and coffee was so much better.,3.0,1

I got the 2.0 last week as a gift, and I brought 50 variety cups. I tried 10 cups and only 2 worked. I searched online and I found that many consumers have already complained about how selfish the 2.0 is. It only reads specific cup which has special print on the cover of the cup, so the machine itself even cannot process some of the old K-cup. What a selfish idea!,1.0,1

We gave a review before indicating how you cannot brew more than 10oz, well we called customer service as it indicated on our feedback and was told we need to buy the VUE pods which will brew more ounces. We go out of our way to find these VUE pods as we were instructed, spent $13 for a box, put one into our 2.0 and get the "oops this pod does not work with this system." Seriously Keurig, you do NOT know your own machines. We are over the new Keurig systems and gonna let people know it is a waste of time and money. My husband is super upset at we had had to go thru, twice and the system is a big FAIL!!,1.0,1
We have owned this bed (in a king size) for almost a month and we absolutely LOVE IT!  After much searching and reading reviews at walmart.com, we did a side-by-side comparison of this bed and a couple of other ones and decided on this one and couldn't be happier.  It is like heaven in a bed!  We love having the innerspring with the memory foam.  Its a great combination.  It cradles and supports your body and as soon as you get up, the memory foam just raises back up!  

As soon as we opened it, it raised right up to full size.  However, we let the mattress just sit and air for about 36 hours and slept on it the following night.  And I can honestly say we haven't slept that good in a very long time.  Best purchase we have made.   We placed the mattress on top of our existing box springs, but as the time is coming to replace the box springs we decided to just buy a smart base bed frame to put the mattress on since that is what we did with our kid's hybrid mattresses and it has worked out great.  My sister loved our bed so much that she and my brother-in-law ordered a king one and also bought the smart base bed frame.  And my parents are wanting to order one too!   So...we can highly recommend!,5.0,1

We've owned and have been using the microwave for a few months now. I also purchased the mounting kit. I'm glad we bought it planning to mount it because it's a little light for counter use and slides back when pushing door open button. I felt the microwave was priced reasonably but the mount kit was a bit pricey for what you get. With that being said both work well and we appreciate the extra counter space we got having it mounted. For a microwave that may seem small we have found nothing we normally use a microwave for that wouldn't fit in it. We are very happy with our purchase.,5.0,-1

Lately having trouble with buying sheets. I purchased an $65 800 count Egyptian cotton sheet set and in one month it started piling. It was a nice Quality and thickness. But it felt like sandpaper even after washing. So I found a deal at Walmart for a 1800 count bamboo set. No where on the package does it say 1800 count. It only says luxury 1800. However, they felt soft immediately to the touch even though they are half the thickness of my original sheets. The sewing is amateur and the side lengths is short. But I only paid $26 for these sheets. So I guess I get what I paid for. I will see how they wear in the next few weeks. I posted a pic to compare the differences in the sets.,3.0,1

A nice small crockpot for smaller families. It does take a little longer to cook foods because it does not heat as well as the larger crockpots.

Was so excited to get this new 2.0 Keurig. Got it in the turquoise color and it's so cute. HOWEVER, we soon noticed it only accepts "K-brewed cups" with a white rim. All our other older pods (that were recently purchased at a discount home store) like "Tullys", Grande Kaffe /Classic salted caramel, Celestial iced tea (sweet raspberry black tea & southern sweet black tea) do not work. Instead you get the error message....OOPS! Fortunately, our old Keurig will still brew the cups. Not a fan of this new machine, b/c of that issue.,1.0,1

This review is for the Hotel Brand 600 Thread Count Sheet Set. This is the King sized sheet set and the color is cream. They are nice and soft and I do like the feel of them. I was immediately impressed with the fitted sheet which fits perfectly over my deep mattress which also has a three inch mattress topper on it. I hope you can see from the picture the long band which stretched and covered my entire mattress; the label calls it "Optifit" I call it the first time a fitted sheet has covered my entire mattress in a long time LOL. The gathering that makes the sheet fitted has a sewn in white band all around. Also remarkable is that the flat sheet seems longer because it hangs way over the bottom of the bed with the top being all the way at the top and the sides hang nice too. However the test will be when it is washed but it sure is nice now. OK so I took them off my bed and washed according to the label. They washed just fine so I put them in the dryer per the label and voila; they still fit the same. Yes I certainly would recommend this set.,4.0,1

The Hotel Brand 600 Thread Count Sheet Set has been a luxurious addition to our bedding. We have the King size set in white, and we really can’t say enough great things about the quality of these sheets. They are made with pure Egyptian 600 Thread Count Cotton, which gives them a soft, clean feel. It did take a couple of washes to make them really soft, but I prefer the very little bit of “crispness” you get with brand new sheets. I love falling into my bed with these sheets on at the end of the day! Immediately upon receiving the sheet set, I threw them in the washer and dryer. The sheets dried very quickly, and they came out of the dryer wrinkle free, which is a very nice feature. However, I did read that you need to take them out of the dryer immediately or they will wrinkle (as you can see from the attached photo). The fitted sheet has a thick elastic band around it making a snug fit on either an extra tall mattress or a thinner mattress. My only complaint about the Hotel Brand Sheet Set is that it only came with 2 king size pillow cases, when I really need four pillow cases. The King set includes a flat sheet (110" x 104"), fitted sheet (78" x 80") and 2 pillowcases (21" x 40" each). Overall, I would highly recommend Hotel Brand 600 Thread Count Sheet Set to anyone looking for a luxury sheet set at a more affordable price.,4.0,1

Why do they have to go and mess with a good thing. Walmart use to sell select edition 600 thread count sheets. They were soft and held up to repeated wear and washing. They were much thicker and softer than this new style.  I had three pairs and rotated them weekly.  As with any high thread count sheet set the fitted sheet wear out eventually.  But, for the money they were wonderful sheets. Still using the flat sheet and pillow cases. Walmart discontinued the select edition brand and now sell these sheets instead. They are not as thick, or as soft and have not held up as well. The elastic on the fitted sheet has stretched out and now I have to tuck the excess under the box spring. Not happy with these sheets wish they would bring back the select edition brand!! If you had purchased the select edition sheets you would not be happy with this new style.,1.0,1

The fabric is really nice and the pattern as well. It's comfy to sit down if you like to sit straight, not meant for you to sit and relax for hours, but then again it's not a couch.

More difficult to put together than thought. First the paper labels are difficult to remove...can still see where they are. Directions are sketchy..make sure you put the rungs the right way..once screws in, difficult to change, we had to go out and buy new screws. Seem a little high, by about 2 inches, but the cushion goes down..so they work. They look good!,4.0,1
I used this shade in my laundry room that gets some western exposure. Wanted light in morning and darken afternoon and night. It works well now, however some issues out of the box. The shade itself had come apart. The top gears are made of plastic and the attachments at the top of the rod had pushed in so the shade wouldn't stay together or attach. We worked through it, pulled out the tab ends on the roller part, attached to the top and worked a bit on the gear so it would go up and down. Note, as stated on the description, only pull on the bottom and it goes up and down SLOWLY. But if you plan to just switch between open sunlight and closed (versus raising all the way up) it should work fine.,4.0,-1

I like the looks of this item BUT the instructions are terrible! What is all this extra stuff in the carton? I see a five inch long cylindrical clear plastic thing that is not labeled and not referred to in the instructions, A "Brewer Maintenance Accessory" that the instructions use its Name (see above in quotes) more than the tell you WHY you need to use it, two extra filters (thanks, but there are no instructions on how to install the filters nor is there any indications that it comes preinstalled (or not). So I sit here and wonder, do I need to install one of these puppies, or do I have two spares?.. hmnm. Additonally, there like 3 or 4 sets of individual instructions between the maker itself and some of the accessories rather than all included in the main manual. Its like they spent the whole budget on a nice-looking coffee maker and then phoned in the important parts of the consumer experience. What a nice downer before I even make the first cup. I am not sure if I have it assembled correctly or if the important water filter is preinstalled. Of course, in response to this review I will get a canned "Oh, I'm sorry..." response that nearly everyone else got.,2.0,1

I LOVE my Keurig 2.0! I drink coffee EVERY morning, and having the choice to brew one cup, or a whole pot is so convenient. On mornings that my husband doesn't want coffee-and I don't know how he survives the day-I can make just one for myself. And I love that I can make a 10oz mug, some single serve machines only make a 6oz cup! But mornings when both of us want coffee, I can make a whole carafe, which is very nice. The only thing I would change, is having the 10oz option for dispensing hot water for times when I want a cup of tea. But other than that, I absolutely love it!,4.0,1
Have previously owned older models of Keurig brewers. In order to make a larger cup, we use the same K-cup twice. However, when you try to use the K-cup twice with the 2.0 system, it tears the top and bottom of the K-cup and most of the coffee grounds end up in the cup. Took 2.0 back and purchased a K40 which is better suited for our requirements. 2.0 works very well for smaller cup sizes but not suitable for our needs. Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review.,2.0,1

This Zebra Blind is the Best window treatment I have ever purchased. Beautifully made and VERY easy to install. Light touch to roll either up or down, perfect in every way! I look forward to replacing other windows with the Zebra Blind. I read several reviews and the individuals who tried to 'inside mount' made a bad choice and can't blame the company. These individuals didn't read all the information and could have saved themselves their disappointment. Vent on the cheapest vinyl roller shades when installed inside the window will have a gap on either end, the mechanical ends need their space, it's common sense to not know that. These individuals need to have Professional install if this simple install is too much for them to handle.,5.0,-1

I am so thankful I received this product to test for free from Influenster. I have used Keurig products before but I only used the mini version or an older version my work had. I really like the amount of cup sizes you can brew. I was also pleased that I could fit just about every size of mug under the brewer. Once the water was heated, it brewed coffee very quickly. The only issues I really had with the brewer was you are limited to Keurig K-cups. While there are a lot out there, that definitely limits the cups you can use. Also, while you can brew a carafe, you have to buy it separately. Overall, I am very pleased with the new 2.0 k250 brewer!,4.0,1

I upgraded to the K250 after having one of the recalled mini's. I was waiting for the K250 rather than just get another mini because I was reading the features and really wanted bigger cup sizes. First of all if you are using a regular k-cup you only get 4 cup sizes, 4/6/8/10. I was hoping to go to at least 12oz for my bigger mugs. I cannot see a way to do that unless using a carafe. There are very limited options on the screen. I do not have a carafe but presumably when you remove the tray and insert a carafe you get more options? It's not a bad looking unit but also if I leave it plugged in like my two older keurigs it does actually stay on with the water heated. I don't like that. I don't want to have to unplug every time (because I know I will forget) and I feel it dangerous to leave heated all day long. The only advantage I see right now is that I can fit bigger mugs in without having to remove the drip tray - but I can't fill them. I am sure the carafe would solve a few of my issues but it doesn't come with the K250, you have to purchase it. Looking at the reviews (about not keeping warm) and the pictures I have seen I am not sure a plastic carafe would be worth the extra money. Sorry, I love my coffee and wouldn't be without my one cup brewer (I have a keurig at home and in my office, I even take them away with me if I am out of town) but I had higher expectations of this model.,3.0,1

I love it! My most favorite comfy recliner had some cosmetic damage on the seat and the footrest stuffing was falling out. We were going to toss it which saddened me, because it would cost more to repair than replace. When I happened across this I thought I would try it out. I didnt even know they made these. I love it! My recliner got a facelift, added a punch of color to my living room, and I get to keep my super comfy recliner!!! I just wish the fabric were slightly thicker or had a backing. It is t shirt material, very light and soft. It comes in 4 pieces that stretch over the seat, each arm, and the back for a perfect fit. Similar to some car seat covers. Overall it is better than expected!,5.0,1
It's about an inch shorter than any other chair I have sat in. You wouldn't think that matters but virtually everybody who tried it said the same thing. Lumbar support is okay, but overall the cushions are quite stiff. This chair does not come assembled and the markings on the backrest where you line up the frame in order to attach the screws were not level with the ground. So basically if it hadn't looked at it before putting in the screws, the backrest would have been at an angle. Not bad for a cheap chair. But not great by any means.,1.0,1

I have quite a few winter sweaters that are hand wash or machine wash gentle cycle only. I don't put them in the dryer so that 1) they don't shrink; and 2) they don't pill. In the past I've dried them on a towel on my kitchen countertop which takes a couple of days to completely dry. This little marvel dries them in a third of the time plus folds up to a couple of inches which makes it fit quite nicely in the space between the washer and dryer.

Great product!,5.0,1
I just got my rugs, transaction was smooth, they got here earlier than expected. I was not disappointed, they look great, they don't look cheap, the only reason I couldn't give it the fifth star is because the actual color on the rugs is more pale than the one in the picture. At first i thought they had sent me the wrong pair of rugs, but its just the color, not as vivid as in picture.,4.0,1

These are not bad for a 600 count sheet set. The softness of the sheets is not as soft as some. But it doesn't feel bad against your skin.
The cream color is more of a yellowy cream. But it is a nice shade.
When I saw on the package that it is Hotel Brand I was intrigued. After I opened the package and examined the product I totally understand why. They remind me of a hotel sheets. They are thicker than most sheets that you can get. I think that this is a good thing as I usually have to replace sheets after they get thin where my feet are. These sheet will definitely last longer than any previous sheets I have had.
I really like the elastic around the fitted sheet. It is not the usual thin strip around it. It is 1" wide. All the way around. It should help the sheet to stay in place better. It does make it so that you have to work to put on sheet straps if you use them. But it can be done. And they may not be necessary with how wide the elastic is. And it seems like strong elastic too.
Also on the fitted sheet it has a strip on elastic to make it so that it will fit better on the corners of your mattress. Never seen this before. It made it easier to put the fitted sheet on my bed. I have a mattress and a foam mattress to cover with the fitted sheet. It fit really well. And even had room to spare. It says it can fit a mattress up to 20" deep. Mine is about 13" and I had no problem.
There are 2 downsides to these sheets. Both are because of how thick the material is. One is that they are noisy. It takes some getting use to. Barely even moving makes a noise. And the other is they wrinkle really bad. Right out of the dryer and they look as if they need to be ironed. Not a fan of ironing sheets.,3.0,1
I received this coffee pot for a gift. After several cups of coffee i started getting the message: Brew interrupted. I called the company and they sent me a new one. After the 4th cup it started saying the same thing again. This time they sent me a new part. After the 5th cup of coffee it started doing the same thing again. Once again they sent me a new one. If it messes up again, I'm going to insist on a different model. I am not happy with this one at all.,1.0,1

Very disappointed in the style of this Keurig. Who designs a water reservoir in the back of the machine. Every time I want to fill the water reservoir I have to pull it out from underneath the cabinet. Wish I would have looked at other models, but liked the price on this one. Also would like a power button on the coffeemaker.,3.0,1
I have a Keurig Vue brewer that I love. This thing was a Christmas present from my daughters. Shame on you for selling this piece of junk that got stopped up after one use. Now I can't use it.

I was doing my normal Walmart shopping when I happened to pass by the rug aisle. The 5' x 8' version of this rug caught my eye. It was gorgeous!! And just what I was looking for!! I am having new laminate flooring installed in my house, and was looking for a cream colored area rug for the living room. Well, I rushed home, got my credit card, and rushed back to Walmart to buy this rug, and two matching throw rugs to go with it. I vacuumed the rug, then used my Hoover steam vac to shampoo it (to get rid of the 'new rug' smell and any manufacturing dust). I then hung the rug over a tall ladder in the sun to dry. The rug is absolutely beautiful, and feels very thick and luxurious when you walk on it! I can tell it is very high-quality. If I could give it ten stars, I would!!! I recommend buying a rug pad to make the rug last a long time and prevent slippage on hard floors.,5.0,1
This seemed like such a great idea I bought one for a gift as well.  I don't think it lasted more than five times before it burst at the connection.   Good idea, poorly executed.  When you read the five star reports, notice the "I've only used it a couple times" comments.   If it had lasted a mere 10 times I would have given it two stars.,1.0,1

The very first one of these I bought I loved it. I have bought several since then and had to return because when I got them and rolled them out they were all stretched out and didn't lay straight.

I thought this would be better than the smaller brewer for larger cups. I still have to take the drain tray out to fit my cup under it. It's slightly better, but still not great.

The biggest inadequacy of this product is the connection to the faucet.  It does not screw on tightly, leaks and with pressure in the hose flys off the faucet.

Yeah ... the rugs are not nearly as brightly colored as represented in the composition photos. Quality is just so-so. Feels plush to your bare feet, but also lumpy, like real stones! There seems to be a slight rubberized coating on the back, but not nearly enough to hold the rugs securely in place. Stitching looks a bit ragged. I do like the design, though. Guess that's why we all bought them!,3.0,-1

Bought to protect leather recliner from dogs overnight. The cover is sturdy & should last a long time. Our recliner back is taller than the chair this is designed for, so we can't use the connecting straps (I expected that from measurements). I do have to re-situate it in the mornings, but that was also expected. It does stay put throughout the day with human use (when the dogs are not sleeping on it). It collects less hair than I expected, & a lint roller easily takes care of what is there. For the price & the purpose, I am pleased.,4.0,1
The sleek style of this Keurig is very appealing. I am a frequent coffee drinker, and have no desire to use any other brand of coffee other than Keurig brands (the kcup offers all I want, while larger size cups are extremely limited). My issue is that I like to brew more than 10oz with one Kcup. The 2.0 K200 brewer I recently purchased limits the amount you can brew without changing to a different pod, and therefor, it doesn't suit my taste like the single-serve mini that I previously used for the past 2 yrs. Even after cleaning and running water through several times, I get a plastic taste on top of the limited ounces. If I can't get this resolved, I won't be using this system anymore.,3.0,1

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Everything about the umbrella is top notch in my book!

I specifically ordered this model because I desired an umbrella with a manual lift as opposed to a crank system, to avoid the breakage caused by over-cranking. Also, in that same category, I did not want a tilt system for the same reason - breakage. I am hoping this model will be around for years to come!,5.0,-1
The sheets are very soft but they are too big. I could hardly get the fitted sheets to fit snugly as you can see from the picture. Also, it is difficult to tell which way to put it on the mattress. The top sheet hangs almost to the floor, and my mattress is not set low. The pillow cases are also baggy looking, and my husbands pillow is probably about 6 inches of thick foam.

The top sheet has a nice decorative thin silk line along the top. The pillow cases also have it. The fitted sheet has a wide elastic band all the way around the bottom to help keep it on the mattress. I like this feature better than the ones that only have the elastic at the corners.

The set only comes with 2 King pillow cases. We have 4 King size pillows between my husband and I, so that's always a pain to have to buy additional ones separately.

Bottom line: The sheets are very soft and cozy, and the only thing that I really do not like is how wrinkled the fitted sheet is on the mattress.,4.0,1

I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my husband, to replace a Keurig Mini that has been positively plagued by problems with grounds continually clogging the needle, etc. It's so disappointing to see in other reviews that while this is a new and improved product, the malfunction continues to be a recurring problem. But the biggest reason that I am returning this machine without giving it to my husband is the restriction on which coffee pods can be used in the machine. We like to use Dunkin coffee, among others. Though this restriction on Keurig's part is a classic capitalist move, it just seems downright unAmerican. It's laughable to see Keurig respond to complaints about this limitation with the comment, "We're sorry to hear you have k-cup pods that will not brew in your new 2.0 K250. " They're sorry to hear it? It's exactly what they wanted. They designed it that way. Sorry, but I just can't support that kind of corporate malfeasance.,1.0,1

I have been looking for good soft sheets for months- tried 100% cotton and microfiber- cotton was too scratchy, microfiber did not fit well and was too hot.  These are just the right color, fit well, but still too hot- even though they say they are cool.  The pillowcase has a nice decorative pleat- but only on one said- why didn't they put it on both sides of the pillowcase.  And the top sheet has no decorative fold at the top at all- hard to tell the top from the bottom.- it would have looked so much better to have the pleat on both sides of pillow case and the top of the flat sheet.  It would have looked much more elegant.,4.0,1

I previously had a Tassimo, and the coffee was never hot enough. Bed Bath & Beyond was having a special offer and I had a gift card so decided to try the Keurig. Taste of coffee is much better and definitely hotter. I am happy with my decision except that I chose the K250 with 40 ounce water reservoir and although I am not a big coffee drinker, I find I need to refill the reservoir very often. That is disappointing and annoying, but I guess I should have taken the time to figure out that I should have purchased a model with a bigger reservoir.,4.0,1

Although I have access to a Keurig at work, this is the first one that I've owned in my home. I enjoy how quick it is to brew a cup of coffee, especially since a full pot would be too much for one person. The display is very easy to use and intuitive. My one complaint is that there isn't an option to adjust the beverage temperature. For some reason, the Keurig at my office brews hotter than this model. I personally prefer my beverages on the hotter side. I enjoy the variety of K-cups that are available, but I wish that previous versions were compatible with the 2.0 systems.,3.0,1

I recieved this as gift for christmas and I love it. Haven't ran into no serious problems with the machine. But I do know I don't waste as much as coffee now like in the past with my regular coffee machine, by making to much coffee and throwing it out, or by just wanting 2 or 3 cups "not a full pot" and making it the worst 2 to 3 cups of coffee so it gets dumped out " more waste" . Yes, the pods can be expensive look around you can get deals on the pods. I've spent $5 on a box of pods not to be bad, just look around. And for your regular coffee thats where our carafe comes in and we use it. It all up to you to make it costly or not.,4.0,1

Ordered this chair for 19 month old daughter and she and her older sister (3yrs+) fit it well and my youngest likes sitting on it. It came pre-assembled and is a solid chair. It is clear that it will last a long time. We ordered white finish and definitely a bright white finish. It does not have any screw holes but a few staple holes near armrests and rocking base. My only complaint is the seat portion. There are visible staple holes and a slight imperfection in the paint. I do not understand why the staples could not be filled before painting since it would have made this chair perfect. Also between the slats seem a little rough and I worry bare legs might get a slight scratch. I am tempted to return for the seat flaw but the rest of the chair is great. So I may just put a cushion to hide it.,4.0,1

I've wanted a Keurig for a whle now and got one for my birthday. I love the conveience of being able to brew one cup. However, I do find the "pod coffee" to be much more expensive so I thought it would be great to buy the coffee holding pod so I could use my own coffee. Evidently not possible on the 2.0. What a bummer. I'm very disappointed. My friends have older brewers which do hold off market pods where you can use your own coffee. I'm thinking Keurig got smart and now doesn't allow that. Wow. Good job on that one, but I'm not a happy customer. Tried searching on Keurig site for one, can't find it. Again, not a happy customer.,2.0,1

I read the reviews about the pods, but I knew all the pods I had said, "Keurig" on the box and were the same companies that Keurig is partnered with, so I didn't think my five boxes of pods would go to waste. Apparently I was wrong and they won't work in my brewer. These pods are not inexpensive and I feel that I have wasted a lot of money trying to upgrade my model. I think Keurig should have really thought this through better. Why alienate your own customers this way. I can't believe anyone is going to be happy throwing away all their unused pods. If my pods would have worked I would have been happy with my purchase.,3.0,1

I would give this product "0" stars of that were possible. This is the worst prefab piece I have ever purchased. None of the holes matched up properly, and elements of this component are cardboard. The backing is particularly flimsy. Because I ventured to attempt to put this together, it is not returnable, despite the fact that it is unusable, so I guess I am out the money. This cabinet would never be able to support the weight of a microwave oven. I doubt that the cheap surfaces would survive even one cleaning. I debated putting this cabinet to the curb as trash, but instead will attempt to find a use for it. Maybe to store light linens in the attic. I will never purchase a brand online that I'm unfamiliar with again. Live and learn I guess.,1.0,1
Best sheets I have got. Waiting for the teal to come back.,5.0,-1
I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder. My husband and I are used to sleeping on soft sheets, and these didn’t feel soft on our skin. It felt softer on my fingers before I washed it, but after putting it through the wash cycle once, following their directions to the letter, the sheets felt rough on my face. I thought that it would feel rough sleeping on them, but it wasn’t bad. It’s like it has mega doses of starch in it. And it makes a sound when it is moved. I think it’s a bit loud when trying to get to sleep. But comfort wise, it wasn’t uncomfortable to sleep on, and even the pillowcase against my face wasn’t noticeably abrasive. When I asked my husband what he thought of the sheets, he said, he was expecting them to be softer and replied, “They’re cool sheets that are not scratchy or soft.” Because the sheets don’t feel like those awful polyester/cotton blends, this set is a blessing. I agree that the set is beautiful. There is a sheen to them that makes me think of a pearl. That and the nice bright white color, make it an attractive sheet set. It’s mostly a plain set of sheets and that’s good, because my last set of sheets had a lot of embroidery on the top sheet, which not only made it uncomfortable to the touch, but under my rigorous washing system, it drew up in that section. There’s only a thin strip of decorative white thread at the top of the top sheet and the mouth of the pillowcases, and that is enough to give it a nice look. Plus, the sheets didn’t draw up there. But then again, it might draw up if I had put the sheets in a hotter dryer cycle, as I did my old ones. I discovered that “Egyptian cotton” doesn’t mean much. It’s not an effective guide in finding comfortable sheets. My last pair was, and it led me to think these would be as comfortable, but they’re not even in the running. Two additional features I liked about the set, is that it has a wide elastic strip around the fitted sheet and on the outside, there is this beautiful gathering of material that is very appealing. I don’t know what a seamstress calls that, but it’s a shame that it’s hidden under the mattress and top sheet. I also like how big the king size top sheet is. I chose this set because I wanted to hide the fact that, underneath, lies a tall queen size air mattress. It totally hides it. Since our king-size bed isn’t here yet, I couldn’t test how well it fit a king size mattress. However on this queen size air mattress that stands twenty-three inches high, the fitted sheet covers both sides at the middle and though it covers the top portion of three corners, it exposes their lower portions, near the floor. On the top right corner, eight and a half inches were exposed as were six inches on the bottom left corner area. As tall and thick as the fancy mattresses are, like the memory foam mattresses, I do feel that it would cover most of it, if not all. My only concern was that it wouldn’t be a good corner fit. It just didn’t seem wide enough for a king. Besides being softer, one feature that I wish it had was large print labels that said, “Top Left Corner”, “Top Right Corner”, “Bottom Left Corner”, “Bottom Right Corner”. It was hard to tell the short side from the long side, because of the elastic. In summation, I’ve only had these sheets for a week, but this model did not tempt me to own a second set.,2.0,1

I was in love with my keurigs and their customer service until I bought the red pot and found out the I can not use my old pods because they have coded the machine to read the lids and it will not brew my older starbucks pods.

I am user of their coffee service and have only bought quality pods for all my pots I don't know if all their systems are this way but I am so disappointed.

Love this appliance! It grills hamburgers (frozen patties) in 10 minutes, unfrozen in about 5 minutes. The fat drains off and there are nice griddle marks on the meat patties. My husband and I love the flavor of grilled burgers and this is just perfect. I Would definitely recommend this item to anyone who grills, from cheese sandwiches to vegetables (haven't tried this yet) it does it all. Grilled some frozen chicken breasts and it took longer than the instruction booklet said it would, by about 5 minutes. Just make sure that the hamburger and chicken isn't either raw or pink in the center. An amazing appliance for those who are tight on time.,5.0,1

I recently had to move my wife to an Assisted Living Facility. We had to furnish her room, which has hardwood floors, therefore also had a lot of echo in the room. I ordered this rug not only for cutting down on the echo but to enhance the looks of the room, which it does beautifully. I'm totally satisfied with the color and the quality. I may even order a second one because I found that the room is large enough in which to push two of them together and therefore almost make it look like a carpeted room. I fully recommend this area rug.,5.0,1

Set up was easy but I'm not sure about the quality. It's only been out of the box a couple hours but the corners are week and not up like they should be and the sides are week and compress a lot when you sit up unlike other mattress with better support. The bed is lumpy and slopes between the springs. I'm not sure if it needs to sit longer to fully expand or just junk. I actually canceled a bed from a furniture store to buy this as it was cheaper and seamed better but now thinking I made the wrong decision. No paperwork so I'm not even sure who I'd call or what can be done if I'm not satisfied. My otherbed that this replaced was all foam. It is a lot sturdier and less motion. I don't expect to sleep well and not even sure what to do it cost $450.00,1.0,1

So far these sheets are crisp and not very soft.  They have only been washed once so I am hoping they will soften with additional washing and use.  One reviewer said they are "noisy" and I tend to agree.  They remind me of something that has been line-dried in the sun...stiff.  Also, my mattress is 13 inches deep and these sheets fit just about right.  I would be very hesitant to use on a bed that had a thicker mattress.  The sheets also wrinkle slightly after being dried.  100% cotton tends to do that.  If you are looking for easy care I would look for a cotton blend.,3.0,1
Just got it in today. Spent a lot of time searching for a really good rug that's durable and washable. Seems to be made well. I find it's beautiful.

Easy to assemble - I mean easy! Sturdy too. I purchased 2 of the black because I have black granite counter tops.

I've had the product for about a month now.  The picture looks better than the actual product.  It is very thin material, which is good because it doesn't add a lot of weight to the comforter, but feels cheaply made.  The stitches in the pintucks are coming apart already.  There isn't any ties on the inside to keep the comforter in place so it doesn't move around inside the cover, so we  have to keep pulling up the comforter to the end.

I had searched for a long time to find accent chairs that were cloth, dark, and under $100. When I found these I was so happy! They were shipped for free to the Walmart right near my house and the boxes (I bought 2) were small enough to fit easily into the back of my car. Assembly was easy.

We have owned a Keurig for several years and ours was starting to malfunction at times so we bought a new one. What a disappointment.

Was returned within 48 hours and will continue to use our old one.,1.0,1
Iâm so disappointed with this purchase- the header discription for this product states âDurable Outdoor Cushionâ and naturally you would think it would be somewhat water repellant BUT it isnât! Why would it be considered durable if it canât even repel water. Now my old outdoor cushion is inside this cover soaking wet and not drying out because of the âdurable coverâ! I highly recommend that âOutdoorâ be taken off the header for this cushion cover because it does NOT need to be used outdoors! I would not recommend this item for an outdoor cushion and wish I would have never wasted my money on it!,1.0,1
Before using this product I was only a casual coffee drinker. Now I can't get enough! The design of the machine is so simple, yet elegant and easy to use.

I have been sleeping on the Modern Sleep Pillow Top Mattress for several days now and I have to say I just love it. I have fractured several vertebrae in my back so a good night's sleep does not come easily. This mattress is great and has just the right blend of good support without being too hard. The mattress is constructed of 8 inches of innerspring coils on the bottom and 6 inches of foam at the top. The foam is of two different kinds so you get the best of both worlds. Memory Foam conforms to you individual body shape but memory foam by itself can retain too much body heat. The brilliance of this mattress is that it combines layers of memory foam with layers of Cool Gel Foam which gives you the comfort without over heating. The innerspring coils on the bottom adds a just little "bounce" to the mattress so it does not feel like you are sleeping on a slab.

As I said, I have severe back problems and it is just such a pleasure to wake up and start my day without that ache in my lower back that I had with my last mattress, which I only purchased a year ago. I spent a thousand dollars on that mattress only to be greatly disappointed. The Modern Sleep Pillow Top Hybrid sells for about half that price and is way more comfortable.

The shipping on this mattress seems a little odd at first but is actually a real plus. It comes compressed, vacuum sealed, rolled and boxed. While it is still quite heavy, 110 pounds according to FedEx, the smaller size and shape of the package makes it easy to get through doorways and around awkward corners that some homes have. Once in place just remove the box and the outer plastic wrap and unroll the mattress on top of the bed or platform you are using. Then simply release the compressing by cutting along the edge of the plastic casing. It says the mattress will re-inflate in 24 to 72 hours but mine was full sized in minutes.

I could not be happier with this mattress and I highly recommend it. My daughter is already saying she wants one too!,5.0,1

These sheets are thicker than other sheets that I have. When I took them out of the package, they were smooth to the touch. I laundered them before putting them on the bed. I wanted to see how the fabric would perform on its own so I did not use any fabric softener in the laundry process. When I took them out of the dryer, they were so wrinkled and rough. My guess is because they are 100% cotton, they will always have the wrinkles after they are dried. After laundering, the texture was a little rougher. They were easy to put on the bed and I liked the elastic sewn all the way around the fitted sheet. The elastic made the bottom sheet fit snugly under the mattress. I noticed that the slight roughness of the sheets made it more difficult to roll over in bed without rolling the top sheet with me. The sheets did not seem to soften any during the week I had them on the bed. Overall, the quality is excellent. The stitching appears to be secure. The elastic makes the fitted sheet really fit the bed. They are not as soft as other sheets I have and they are extremely wrinkled. Some fabric softener may solve the softness problem and release some of the wrinkles.,4.0,1

one of the corners of the fitted sheet was not stitched, and the pillowcases were only hemmed on one side and the fabric on the other side was totally unhemmed. I have never had any sheets like this. The color was vibrant and fabric very soft, but was really put off by the poor quality workmanship.  I took them back to my local Walmart to return them, and was told by the customer representative, Ellen, that I needed the box they came in, but I didn't have it. Fortunately, they had a box and she put the sheets in it, and taped it shut.  I inquired about some type of paperwork showing that I had returned them and she said I would get somethin in an email, and to date I haven't had one.,2.0,-1
Fell apart on second wash,1.0,1
The "Modern Sleep Pillow Top 14" Hybrid Cool Gel Memory Foam and Innerspring Mattress" is surprisingly comfortable. There's a softness to the mattress because of material used on the top and sides. At the same time, there is a firmness to the mattress as it supports one's body.

The depth of the mattress that I have is 14". This caused the mattress to rest rather high on my foundation (I used my old boxspring). I loved it. It felt like a real treat to get into bed every night. There is a foundation sold on Walmart.com that states that it is 4" so that may be a great addition for anyone interested in keeping their bed closer to the ground. For myself, the height is perfect.

Due to the depth of the mattress, sheets with deep pockets (for each corner) may be needed. I happened to have a sheet set that allows for a deep pocketed mattress and it worked well. Initially, I attempted to use a regular (didn't have deep pockets) sheet set and the sheet kept coming up and off of the corners.

Keep in mind that there are others mattress depths available in the Modern Sleep line up of mattresses through Walmart.com. This mattress is the best one I have ever owned.,5.0,1

To be honest when I was growing up we bought sheets at the thrift store and used those. When I got my own place, I bought the cheapest on the shelf and used those. Never one to travel much. These arrived very quickly. Nicely packaged. The first thing I noticed was the weight. To me, the package felt heavy for a box of sheets. Once I got the package home and on the table, I opened the box to discover the sheets were a beautiful color. I read the package. 100% egyptian cotton with sateen weave. I could not possible explain how many hours of my life, on how many different visits I have spent standing in the bedding isle looking at sheets. Yes, just standing there debating. Only to walk away, telling myself I would get a good quality set another time. But that time really never came. Anyways, the set is one size bigger then what my bed is only because I have neck and spinal damage and I found it is less painful for me to get it on and tuck it under. I can see making the beds will eventually become a kid chore around my house. Once we got it on and tucked, we jumped in bed to try them out. My daughter and I. She said they felt so soft and silky. I found the weight of the sheet, which is a bit heavier then the cheapest ones we have been using added a bit of quality comfort allowing us to sleep much deeper, longer. No matter how much tossing or turning I did, the sheets never balled up, and the material stayed silky smooth. the lesser sheets tend to feel like sand paper after a while. I toss and turn a lot due to pain. To be honest I never felt nor used sheets like this before now. Just knew that the better thread count meant better sheets, was not sure how. After using and reviewing these, I cannot see myself without them. I guess what it boils down to is... There is nothing wrong with cheaper sets of sheets. But if you want to have a high quality sleep on sheets that are extremely soft, sheets that will last and last, I would highly recommend these sheets. As a person with painful disabilities, sleeping is the most painful thing above all else day or night. Using these sheets allowed me to toss and turn less, sleep deeper, with out all the other issues the cheaper sheets caused. I would highly recommend weather it be your investing into bedding or just unsure of going to a better thread count. I would say after this a better thread count really does make a world of difference.,5.0,1

I LIVE for coffee, strong cup first thing, multiple cups throughout, adore the smell, the taste, the everything about it. I also live in an apartment with limited counter space, so when I purchased my Keurig Mini I was very excited. I LOVED my mini, have had it for YEARS, brewed a fantastic cup of coffee whenever I wanted it. My boyfriend moved in and we used the mini more often, and his travel mug is bigger so we used to brew two cups to fill it, he also likes a stronger brew, and well the mini - after years of use just didn't keep up and broke down (I think I actually shed a tear). So, we purchased a K250 - set it up, swapped the toaster oven for a toaster because of the space, and well ... it looks pretty. Despite the 9 brew sizes it claims to brew (HUGE draw to this machine), the bigger machine doesn't really brew anything more that the mini did. Evidently it's a standard 4 size (and the 10oz is actually less that the 10oz my mini brewed), it's not stronger, not even when you press the strong button, there's no auto shut off, additional 3 sizes are available but only if you buy the KMug (and only 9 varieties available), and the rest are for the carafe (but only for cup portions), so the 9 brew sizes aren't truly available... The strong brew tastes more like water poured over ground up beans than it does a good cup of coffee. We're waiting upwards of ten minutes for the machine to warm up each morning, and overall just disappointed. Worst money on a Keurig spent and zero benefits ...,1.0,1

I purchased this cart to use as a printer stand a few days ago. Overall, I think the cart is a good value for the price. It seems sturdy enough for holding a printer and is attractive. Assembly is relatively easy. I am satisfied with it, with one exception. The laminate surface peels off very easily from the edges. Some peeling occurred on the top of the cart, when I had it lying on carpet to assemble it. I would recommend this printer, but would caution anyone buying it to be very careful when you are assembling and using it, to avoid peeling the laminate surface.,3.0,1

I received this area rug quickly, BUT the way it was packaged was done POORLY, the plastic cover is very thin and it arrived with 3 holes in it and the carpet fibers black, needless to say, I did not open it, I took the packing slip off of it and returned it PROMPTLY to the store. If this rug was packaged correctly, it would be better, I can not share with you the quality of the rug because I did not open it.,1.0,1
Have had the rug for a week now, and still love it! It lay flat from the get-go. We also bought a pad that we haven't put down yet because it arrived after the rug, but it will make the rug more resilient on our tile floor. The color is as represented, no discernible smell, except a hint of new mown grass, which only lasted about five minutes, was quite pleasant. We love the rug, it is our second purchase of that rug. Have had the first, larger rug for a year at least; it is holding up beautifully to our household traffic and is much admired by friends and family. Both rugs are pretty, and add to the beauty and comfort of our home.,5.0,1

this sheet is  not  a deep pocket set as the pockets are only 10" which is just regular size.  I needed a deep pocket set over 16".

The control panel is covered with a plastic overlay that is peeling off on the frequently used buttons.

Very disappointed with my new 2.0 Brewer. Coffee grinds kept getting into my coffee and the water temp wasn't hot enough. When making tea I could only chose from 4oz or 6oz of water. So I had to brew twice just to get a 8oz cup of tea. My old k-pods with the keruig stamp on them still wouldn't work in this new model. So I wasted about 3 boxes of coffee trying to make them work. I guess I should have stopped while I was ahead, but I told that the old pods would work. Last but not least, who likes to tastes coffee grinds in your coffee? But I must admit that the customer service at Keruig was very nice about my problems and offer to replace the unit at no cost to me, but I decided to return it back to the retail store and pulled the old keruig out of retirement.,1.0,1

I have had a keurig for 4 years. LOVED it, have not had a single problem. I saw the 2.0 came in orange, so I decided to splurge. WORST decision ever! I have literally 70 kcups and I can't use any of them! I proceeded to use the samples that came with my new one, and the keurig keeps saying there is a water pressure problem, and to remove the pod. This went on for an hour. I am sending this back and getting another brand, NOT a keurig.,1.0,1

I had high hopes that this hose would work for me. The one I previously had used brass fittings and fit the faucet perfectly; however a dog chewed through the hose and I needed a new one. When I saw this one on sale, I thought I'd give it a try.

When I received the hose, I noticed there were 2 plastic couplings of different sizes to accommodate different size faucets. I used the larger one and it was very difficult to screw onto the faucet. Once screwed on, I turned on the faucet and the hose leaked terribly at the fitting. I thought I had not tightened it enough so I attempted to tighten the connection. At that point the plastic hose fitting split.

Don't waste your money on this hose. Get one with brass fittings.,1.0,1
The only reason I put 4 out of 5 stars was because the color they show in picture 1 looks like a Vibrant orange like a Halloween vibe. Well scroll to picture 4 And thats the actual color It is more like a burnt orange give me like a Thanksgiving vibe. However the sheets are super soft not a weird silky soft like a quilt type soft and they fit over my 18 inch thick king size mattress no problem. I did not need to stretch to fit that last corner of the mattress the sheets went on no problem and got very nicely. I would definitely try again and hope the color shown 6 out of 7 pictures is the color Im  getting! Other than that I purchased a very good quality set of sheets for a really good price,4.0,1
I had done a great deal of comparison shopping in the stores prior to ordering. I had touched and felt cushions in this same price range. I was very disappointed in the quality of this cushion when it arrived. The color was also not what I had imagined. When I went through the process of returning it, the cost of return shipping was deducted from what I had paid for the cushion. Ordering from Hayneedle has left me $9 shorter and I still do not have a cushion.,1.0,1

It is a beautiful umbrella which arrived very quickly and without any issues. It is replacing a 21 year old 11 ft market umbrella with a wooden pole and sunbrella cover which was finally starting to show wear on the cover fabric.

I have an 85 lb. dog who has his favorite chair and place on our couch.  I was looking for something pretty yet practical which would stay in place when my puppy jumped up in his position on our couch to share with my husband when he was watching TV.  Butters, also, has his chair which he sits in when watching guard out the front window and sleeps in when home alone.  The covers have been great.

This replaced a Keurig that lasted just over 2 years and had only had bottled water in the tank. Absolutely hate my new one as it won't take the K cups that I'd come to love.

I have the 5-light fixture in my kitchen and the 3-light fixture in my hallway. They provide wonderful (adjustable) light and look great for their respecitve prices.

Razor sharp out of the package and after chopping away at some 3"-4" round hedge branches for an hour and more, this thing wasn't fazed at all. It was still razor sharp, no chips, dents, dings or folding. Not even a scratch! I kid you not. I was amazed to say the least. It makes me wonder about some of the other feedback I was reading about this product while I was researching it. 5 Stars because I was putting this thing through what I thought was hard work and it killed it. Overgrown hedges and trees in my yard are a common thing for me to have to deal with and gives me a chance to try new things. This bolo was by far the most effective (and fun!) method yet.

These Hotel Brand 600 Thread Count Sheet Set we got in King size are amazingly awesome is so many ways. We love them. The comfort is like sleeping on a soft cool cloud..Yes my photos show the extra generous thick mattresses these beautiful sheets will fit. These sheets are very well made, and in my photo covered our king size pillow top mattress set and an additional six inch mattress we added on top of our mattress set. This look is so striking to my eye, you cannot see the box spring! I am thrilled with that as it is unattractive to see it in many peoples eyes. In my second photo I show the corner of the sheet with a yard stick. The sheet measures at like 18 inches. That is an amazing generous fitted sheet that will fit the new style of very thick pillow top mattresses, or you can do what we did and purchase from WalMart.com a new mattress to put on TOP of an older worn king set, and save a ton on money. We now see when our topper wears out we can buy a thicker one and still find fitted sheets that fit. The construction of these sheets and pillow cases is done with pride, and it shows. Very nice color that will go with anyone bedroom. I say for certain order a set you will love them.,5.0,1

The chair serves as an accent chair in my living room. Like other reviews mention, the back of the chair is much shorter than I would like and looks a little out of place - more like a large child's chair than for an adult. I'm a 5'4" woman and can sit in it easily but my husband or another male (unless he is a small guy) probably wouldn't sit on this chair and be comfortable. The chair came with a few fabric strands that were loose that I had to cut off with scissors. When you sit in the chair, it's noticeable the chair's material is thin and stretchy (like jersey) and the seat of the chair is foam because it squishes down with even a light person sitting on it and then the fabric looks loose. It was cheap enough that if it wears out in a couple years so be it. This chair will definitely look out of place in a large space. It's more suitable for a small room or tight space where you need occasional seating for guests.,4.0,1
We received the Brewer and used it on the same day. We were very curious to see how well it works. Our daughters were equally excited so we decided to make some hot chocolate so the whole family could try. My husband washed and ran the hot water before our first brew.
