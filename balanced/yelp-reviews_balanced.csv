overall experience wonderful service attentive straight point not smothery food local pizza joint high quality can taste chef dining out casual lunch left pleased cash still pocket

first we had roasted eggplant bruschetta baguette toasted perfection crust crisp nice light sourdough flavor chew not over toasted bit still tender inside four baguettes were topped beautiful creamy tangy goat cheese eggplant beautifully roasted naturally rich flavor sundried tomatoes added nice acid element dish served warm well balanced balsamic reduction 

next we tried smoked chicken broccoli pizza crust oh gosh crust perfect thin crunchy tender caramelized wood burning oven perfect golden brown smoked chicken still moist broccoli still had nice bite vegetables should had fantastic roasted flavor no sauce just little olive oil garlic went down before toppings mozzarella smoked provolone were appropriate nice nutty asiago parmesanreggiano would welcome touch bacon course we added bacon applewood smoked bacon although recent years bacon especially applewood smoked has overplayed culinary world nellos kept organic style bacon has wonderful fatty crunch just right balance salt smoke cooked just so half slabs thick delicious bacon were simply laid over pizza towards end cooking very pleased bacon wasnt chopped up into tiny bits 

the banananut bread pudding tempting tiramisu has heart being half italian know tiramisu nellos has made great play classic dessert first thick layer creamy mascarpone sweetened not over power cheese itself ladyfinger layer held integrity wasnt soaked point sogginess pleasant surprise another generous layer mascarpone surprisingly thick dusting cocoa powder great touch 

nellos worth every penny bill two just over 3000 we left full happy too dining experiences can disappointing if little details left out dont miss beat david fantastic server upbeat attitude rest staff also attentive helpful beer wine selection nice well definitely something everyone

should start lower expectations try out new places recently ive walking into overhyped places only get average experience

its 4 pm wednesday afternoon place barely has 12 families eating thats ok must just time day like quiet peaceful restaurants anyways cool decorations nice variety seating dirty plates tables seemed norm plate along significant others plate had weird dirt ash coal seriously if im paying 15 12 pizza im hoping plates get least clean oh well can expect im scottsdale

this totally trustfundpizzaplace pretty much every family dining sippin dat kriss ok maybe not hypnotik were drinking fine wine dont drink alcohol still place seemed little too posh just wanted see buzz about 

we got half plainred halfwhite garlic traditional pizza pretty darn good sauce probably most perfect sauce ive had enough cheese not enough make pizza ridiculously oily however dont go thinking youre gonna get much cheese pizza hut pizza white side pretty good well garlic taste subtle despite large amounts minced garlic only downside white pizza had way too much cheese contrast other side thus little bit too oily make things worse worst part about pizza crust too crispy gourmet woodfire thats cool no one likes overdone crust essentially cracker sauce melted cheese sort deal breaker unfortunately thought rest pizza tasty had hard time understanding rough crust

its funny because had like 30 employees went rather annoying see bunch employees joking around walking around aimlessly needlessly destroying atmosphere cool restaurant dont get wrong pizza isnt spectacular cool place go business meeting treat significant other wonder if pizza overpriced because place overstaffed

if trust fund place favorite place if dont then youll come once only once just say youve if dont follow hype then dont worry about making way over ehre,3,1

rice paper situated busy phoenix road once inside adorable little historic house feels like youve transformed into home away home restored historic house adapted into restaurant can accommodate those looking meal those looking cocktails alike atmosphere very modern zenlike each table places perfectly apart each other quaint light fixtures warming up restaurant long bar seating plenty drinks choose from

most importantly food food delicious perfect combination filling yet light we started spring rolls must warn if order one has spice mentioned description warned do not go light sriracha spring roll delicious so spicy mouth burned good 20 minutes following think also made mistake drinking diet coke attempt ease burning really only made worse burn sriracha seems only disappear if power through

went haus murphys friends work other people most lot more enthusiastic than about going german restaurant cant give useful review because dont like most german food dont drink beer much anymore so ill give can 3 stars because fairness place just aok 

it same weekend glendale chocolate affaire so place packed service little slow we were seated fairly quickly received very good service considering busy place we were seated outdoor patio originally right freaking sun quickly realized we were not happy moved another table soon one opened up shade

the whole table started giant pretzel bread basket pretzel very obviously made wasnt box frozen super pretzels like ones ballpark wasnt oily covered bunch melted butter either just wonderful warm toasty outside soft inside not doughy either highlight meal truthful bread basket included alternating slices rye pumpernickel bread tried rye though know dont like rye bread so dont know did eh

my friend shared bartlett pear black forest sandwich actually turned out pretty tasty black forest ham julienned pieces pear fresh baby spinach mild cheddar cheese walnut spread just tasted like mayonaisse bread looked like ciabbata maybe wasnt side dish either french fries german fried potatoes we went fries 

everyone else got chicken schnitzel chicken breast pounded really thin breaded then baked fried couldnt tell then covered thick white gravy side german fried potatoes sitting really just looked like lumpy mashed potatoes lot butter

and everyone had something alcoholic drink one friend had riesling wine everyone else got either oktoberfest other german beer wish could tell ya really didnt pay attention liked choices though

the prices were not too bad example sandwichfries 895 giant pretzel 500 would paid more than pretzel

overall not horrible experience thought going think pretzel sandwich saved just sitting drinking water watching everyone else eat would go back probably not long long drive live wouldnt drive far even great pretzel however if live near just really like german food beer might place check out if havent already like said review may not very useful,3,-1

small out way cafe suffers problems not least indenity crisis doesnt know whether office managers desk dining area cafe ice cream parlor kitschy antique store

the store had no real antiques just sort craft work one generally finds swap mart

the menu brunchery french toast omlettes egg dishes baked goods sounded good unfortunately execusion cafe fell flat

the sausage cheese omlette obviously microwaved instead being prepared pan stove topped single slice american processed pretend cheese french toast tasted very much like taken freezer popped toaster 

bacon sausage were lowest order bacon being so thin could read paper through possesing no actual flavor all

the promised homemade biscuits were such disappointment went unfinished had better biscuits mcdoanlds honestly mcdonalds makes dreadful biscuits

overall we were extremely disappointed little cafe became even more so check arrived total price disaster almost same if we had gone real resturaunt without thing approches satisfaction one gets dining good food waitresscookmanager very cheerfully gave discount coupons next visit we left sitting table

the food actually so disappointing we ate so little we then went someplace else breakfast

if youre hungry thinking about stopping apple dumpling cafe bite recommend mcdoanlds food cheaper not microwaved moderately better tasting



well days after posting review received meesage owner apple dumpling cafe after due consideration thought id add response message well use statements then respond promotional comments edited out also should like point out location we visited now closed new location queen creek

adc we restaurant catering 25 years
yes everyone has off days apple dumplings we cook everything up fresh no cooking items keeping warm fresh eggs not powdered liquid eggs

dbabh now between wife myself we also nearly 20 years restaurant experience everything family dining way up 4 star restaurants we know good food tastes like wasnt it

adc maybe not used baked biscuits instead warmed microwave ones

dbabh being native west had share delicious tender tasty biscuits campsites local restaurants no biscuits apple dumpling cafe do not qualify were poor quality neither tender nor tasty

adc business growing queen creek apple burger has called one best country many

dbabh am sure business growing good thing new location far enough out discourage reviewer giving second chance apple perhaps if were queen creek one day another reason might stop given low quality food we received first visit think odds happening long indeed,1,1

every once while treated nice dinner medical talk one those times

lets just start saying rollin up jw marriott chevy cobalt really makes beemers benzs pop out after nonvaleting ride walking mandatory 100 yards get resort breath already taken away sheer grandiosity resort colorful flowers roys first floor resortwhich throw off because ground floor considered 2nd level

hostess wait staff were super friendly wasnt sure reservation under made situation light directed needed go started off crunchy golden lobster potstickers togarashi miso butter sauceyeah dont know togarashi think hot dog eating competition coney island last year either way good perfect amount sauce complement lobster meat definitely must try 

also had golden coconut shrimp came mustard mango sweet sour sauce couldve done without shrimp tasted fresh overall thought may little bland guess like little bit more spice lemony kick shrimp probably would like try calamari instead

the last appetizer had crispy spicy ahi sushi roll ginger wasabi could eaten day long hands down number one appetizer try never eat ahi wasabi kick did just enough go back 2nds 3rds

for actual dinner started off seemed like house salad salad need knife addition fork not often get confused food literally had slice each piece lettuce because comes one big piece herb dressing super good made salad only get couple tomatoes cucumber slices hey salad isnt supposed filling so okay it

for main entree got roys roasted macadamia nut crusted mahi mahiand make qualifying statement dont eat much fish prefer beef chicken over fish during every day week since ahi sushi roll so good decided get little fishy also say ive never had mahi mahi before much fun say mahi mahi tasted just fun sounds has perfect amount crustyness just flaked melted mouth mahi mahi comes layered top grilled asparagus layered top medium sliced roasted potatoes one bite multiple tastes works usually im little hesitant chefs try combine too much different flavors into one bite really worked entree 

finished up dessert platter best one cheesecake crust best part pair coffee youve got great ending

ps just because chain doesnt always mean restaurant bad,5,1
learned morning original pancake house ihop two very different restaurants mind ihop much better

we ended up ohop breakfast around 11am sunday we were lucky enough get parking spot table within just minutes once seated noticed tacky interior decorated no big deal big deal tables so close together not much room move place doesnt take credit cards if order couple things ala carte like we did really adds up 

my short stack buckwheat pancakes scrambled egg whites oj plus jareds eggs over easy hashbrowns toast coffee cost 32 before tip breakfast really waitress couldve told no

at least made easy putting atm inside restaurant now too bad additional 250 fee use 

another difference noticed ohop offers only one single kind syrup ihop offers pancakes better latter well one thing ohop has going dutch baby least looks saw people around ordering 

ill choose ihop one locally owned breakfast places future before returning ohop 40 out door simple breakfast two today screw,2,1

went place lunch today friend really nothing would run back think goodness level kind depends add ingredients including seasonings sauces veggies meat starch think instructions could more clearly displayed first see meat then come upon dry spices thought going only flavor source food so used too much if go again big if would choose maybe just ginger something used bunch garlic only find fresh garlic later down line curses

 do good selection veggies seem fairly fresh meat real cut up meat not weird freeze dried meat used these places thought choice noodle bit weird udon kind thick slimy would picked like soba noodles rice noodles something wasnt huge issue just something thought weird had put chili garlic sauce mixed kung pao mixed hint peanut sauce turned out fairly good 

also bit pricey especially only get go up once so can only make one sauce decision if screw up youre kind screwed also other places allow get soup rice something entree would nice considering charge if someone suggested again would go wouldnt go back own,3,1

when make reservations cafe monarch want let christopher know if food aversions allergies maybe even if youre really counting something particular night so can plan advance shops freshest produce selections night restricted being said wish more places did way tiring flip through pages pages menus nearly identical items id just soon told chef bought freshest items possible day inspired served tonight suffice yes yes does thank do understand point

we brought along couple bottle champagne white red byo we figured wed hedge bets not knowing wed mood way also cash check also no credit cards we started champagne christopher told dinner had mind penne pasta pumpkin cream sauce toasted walnuts sliced gorgonzola top next course we would warm salad fresh artichokes olives peppers main course beer braised chicken sounded fabulous course picky eaters isnt just more fun dine good eaters pretty much anything would made we would ate no food aversions table innards take back dont like innards

we enjoyed champagne while worked pasta smells coming kitchen were just intoxicating restaurant itself so cozy too we sat inside time best can describe cross between french bistro buca di beppo ok total disservice cafe monarch has coolest things over walls like buca di beppo does rest could swear back cafe paris pasta came out heaped platter family style sauce lovely pale pumpkin hue accented fresh herbs lovely pungent slices gorgonzola crunchy walnuts pitch perfect we ate much we dared while christopher came entertained stories most restaurants owner manager comes see if everything ok thats fine dandy usually dont want hanging around spouting propaganda chris complete opposite dont want go wish could eat every night told about growing up did last summer joked around girls commented ada gs cowgirl sheik attire ill let go into even explained exactly made couple dishes

the warm salad served next came small cast iron skillet baby sliced artichokes were sautéed capers sweet italian peppers heirloom tomatoes thyme light flavorful welcome departure typical green salad ive eating summer

our final course fit small village platter chicken pieces beautifully browned braised full sail ale braising sauce exquisite spooned over spicy chicken meat cute little pregnant one claims cant eat much anymore even ate two pieces chicken youve got love christopher boxed up leftover pasta chicken into individual boxes

right we thought best over brings over couple slices pumpkin cheesecake walnut brittle like cheesecake usually something wouldnt order because so heavy not one light creamy like baked pumpkin cheesecake chiffon perfect sweet ending beautiful meal

though want everyone out go cafe monarch because think one best restaurants around dont think everyone course can tell allergies aversions call make reservations allergies cant helped course doesnt aversion something other meals like best leave chefs hands relinquish control think need let decide prepare guarantee too slouched back chair rubbing full belly contented sigh lips,5,1

like moth flame totally fall gimmicky stuff time no exception absolutely adore having sushi travel around mini conveyor belt 

at places like these ive learned sushi tends fresher restaurant crowded because chefs constantly replenish sushi thats taken off conveyor belt im not sure turn around time before sushi removed im sure theres secret protocol place noon place boomin 

sushi station had quite variety rolls unagi avocado rolls tempura rolls imagine rolls tiger rolls whizzed belt time read description had wait make rounds before made way back again just so mesmerized movement though trance instead deciding whether wanted roll not similar mobile sushi places usually theres sticker dot indicates price sushi based dot color number dots could tell much each plate petite signs lead each set rolls out so youre never confused each roll like easy each name displayed clear neat signs nigiri also present maguro tuna shake salmon seared tuna tamago also desserts like carrot cake tiramisu jello traveling around

in case food conveyor belt wasnt were jonesing also regular menu booklet could flip through order directly didnt even bother because wasnt fun short attention span have

 after another happy hour visit roosevelt returned carlys visions luscious hummus plaidlike vibe dancing head making mouth drool much more sober disposition actually studied menu severely shocked 

first prices 7 stella hell dubious organic martini wasnt menudid imagine well martini 1012 durants definitely wasnt good martini 

i quickly found hummuspita app ordered large portion growing decidedly more disappointedheartbroken entre options nothing mean nothing sounded even remotely appetizing very rich yet blandsounding does make sense like brie turkey panini bread eh ok hoping would like roosevelt order grilled cheese tomato soup reservation then blown away sad report not so

however huge fan veggie chips came hummus flatbread thank god delicious kindofremembered no problems service rest reviews sounds exactly like plaid except downtownand way lesstasty menu

so 50 later wed had mediocre couple entrees appetizer no buzz leftovers still sitting fridge week later doh 

that really sucks because think foundation restaurant would adore go out way go want support extensive beer selection great ambiance perfect location local ownership please carlys can petition better qualitymore adventurous food options ill even then pay overpriced beer without complaint

editors note seriously does anyone else think beer purchased tops always about 7 degrees too warm cool enough drink warm enough not refreshing drives crazy 

and hang im not done hell makes martini organic anyway nonpesticideinfused nohormonesaddedpotatoes vodka highly dubious indeed,2,1
im incredibly impressed childrens museum phoenix definitely exceeded expectations we went 2 years old 7 months old heaven over place trying figure out liked more climber not only fun such attractive structure enjoyed just looking really wanted climb turn watching baby tricycles little car wash adorable supermarket area hit everything pretty real track little cars could stayed playing day noodle forrest very interesting experience cracking up because son didnt had sense direction 

the staff very courteous nice answered questions promptly seemed happy working 

we didnt even made under 3 area art studio since we had so much fun ideal place go crazy heat we got membership im pretty sure were going visiting every weekend

i disagree unsafe place kids call climber death trap bit much im very hands son just dont watch play play make sure hes ok wont get hurt plays ok others regardless we if kid likes run away like most kids do keep eye close distance especially stairs outside park pose risks well guess if want soft plush might well go pump up kind place

i do however agree most museum probably not most appropriate place 2 years old under guess thats under 3 year old area then cant review we didnt enjoyed visit 

i would say main negatives price do think kids reasonable charge 900 should 2 up no charge reduced charge youngest ones also reduced rate parents know childrens museums do charge everyone same truth told had so much fun didnt mind paying

we cant wait take visiting friends kids nice such amazing place arizona,5,-1

would give three price just kills 

ive twice each time minor disappointment got turkey burger fiance got chicken sandwich we split basket sweet potato fries basket extremely small even if served mini shopping cart turkey burger falls apart easily sort dry killer price meal comes 30 tip pretty hefty cost burger splitting medium order fries

they do nice beer list cupcakes made next door served dessert delicious doesnt outweigh high cost low amount fries awful conversations put up personal view dont live scottsdale

id recommend checking out soma cafe better burger sweet potato fries,2,1
not ordinary steak house nice great new option valley kentucky derby garden party decor hotknowledgeable waitstaff just two things set modern steak apart 

the starter menu includes unusual tasty items like hot cold wedge salad kobe beef foot long hotdog entrees served la carte bonein 20 oz ribeye dry aged great rich flavor side dishes generous portions large enough shared liked parmesan fries asparagus wine list pretty impressive too im not just saying because had favorite cliff lede cabernet if saved room dessert give peanut butter cup try

be prepared check starter entree side dessert wine add up id probably give five stars if had little more curb appeal definitely worthy special occasion monday night out friends,4,1

lamore so good like every place pros cons

cons prices online menu not prices store only had pasta so cant speak entrees dish pasta closer 20 plate than 12 crowd older we were youngest people least 20 years however if ask sign good food older people tend more spend meals thus choose better ones finally little far out way thats only because live downtown phoenix may not issue you

thats got cons 

pros food amazing portions definitely large totally worth cost we tried potato gnocchi red sauce chicken fettucini alfredo tortellini prosciutto peas cream sauce would highly recommend tortellini crazy amazing staff nice even live music setting very romantic not too over top we went girls night even then still fun 

overall totally worth drive worth prices if up sharing special occasion loved,4,1
let say first if could give lower rating way staff childrens museum phoenix treated 0 lower would appropriate unfortunately am limited respect

i believe appropriate let person know cant someplace expected place got expected wasnt allowed stay just same thought appropriate let person expecting does make difference if makes very clear make no more than most minimal effort help do childrens museum phoenix staff handled situation

obviously mistaken thought could pay cash tickets event yelpers were invited place tonight discovered got had buy tickets line ahead time else were out luck mistake think staff place might help let somebody yelp know least got if couldnt stay talk about group people were absolutely unwilling do more than than minimum expected asked if could bring up yelp page computer so could explain someone had happened were going do nothing kind look shock asked apparent faces couple based happened attitude toward told wouldnt back one women said im sorry told would only need said if shed willing least bring up yelp page left truthfully takes lot get say wont go back place case

being so close office ats one spot wanted check out soon saw yelp walking really love layout another restaurant house shop has very breezy open feel not lot seating early only 5pm so werent customers without wait able walk right up order carne asada burrito burrito emphasize ito because got home realized gave burro honestly didnt know difference so cant too upset

biting into burro immediately agreed motto really best carne asada had town great flavor little salty texture perfect wrap perfect little bit added flavor thick well essential juice carne asada only had two issues one may just due mistaken order burro only had meat pico de gallo so little boring delicious boring also others noted pricy even without tip xl burro about 9 got something smaller than chipotle burrito once again delicious bucks more than would liked pay

long story short meat delicious well worth trying out certainly go back try burrito try enunciate words little more,3,-1
ever walked into well decorated home wondered did get stuff well answer likely home goods

having never home goods prior today had no idea expect even still mind pretty much blown much store has offer mean if theres single nook house need filled something home goods has answerfor everything

when say something everything im not really exaggerating we were walking through store see about we encountered so different sections 

of course basics home lamps mirrorswall deco bedding within aforementioned categories prices fantastic designer names ie ralph lauren youre getting upwards 60 off httpwwwyelpcombizphotosmhqsn6hylmvyted6uaa2gselect5npa6jx2tds4rffvliwlyfux6jduyxa10nqikubw

the sections store caught off guard were sections kids storage pets dont know hadnt equated accessories pets into typical home decor though after seeing things offer kind makes sense now mean after allpets huge part family

we only came look around little while dont know if because place just opened up if wednesdays just day shop scottsdale line checkout looooooooooong 

after buzz around place dies down little bit definitely want go back take advantage great deals franchise offers way home decor,4,1
behind oversized door lies dining room wa long bar well outdoor eating area burger buffs can enjoy both food weather both indoor outside areas adorned retrochic furniture cozy enough support back not cozy enough keep comfortable during long stretch burgereating martinidrinking based tables chairs fulled expected see shag carpet make cameo alas nowhere sight

while decor stax straight out late 60s menu anything yet somehow retro feel very appropriate menu takes classic comfort foodslike burgers mac cheeseand brings into 21st century

the muse doublesided menu stax burger poor decisionmakers may find meal stax overwhelming building burger can multistep process

no matter order wont walk away wempty pockets staxstyle burgers 45 apiece while plain meat costs 34 toppingsbacon cheese salsas aioliscost 25 per burger meaning can throw good number topping still keep slider under 5 unless splurge slice foie gras double price custom creation

burgers caliber deserve classyyetcomforting side dishes stax hits mark serving up crispy golden tater tots mini frying basket tots about 5 feed 23 people other side dishes include sweet potato fries onion rings macaroni cheese

during visit order tater tots were treated appetizer brought out good 1015 minutes before sliders arrived figured burgers would out soon so began dipping tots into mayo ketchup standard sauces wan order tots two aiolis one basilflecked pesto other spicy pink sauce turned out standout bunch

presentation just one criteria contributes enjoyment meal more important though flavor salsa atop lamb slider delicious melted cheese feta provided right amount saltiness complement lamb meat unfortunately tasted gamy tend not appreciate lamb while lamb can dry out easily little patty meat juicy flavorful

having sampled elk within past couple months feeling adventurous thus ordered staxstyle ostrich burger topped handpulled mozzarella bruschetta tomatoes leaves fresh basil ostrich juicy flavorful tasting less like chicken more like beef burgers toppings were surprisingly complementary would thought those toppings would bettersuited chicken beef final verdict ostrich yum,4,1

after rereading delux burger review last night compelled eat again lunch today know amaze even myself enough visit reviewed restaurant knew 

there 20minute wait delux so we decided take walk around shopping complex look other stores area wafting out doors tight radius around gelato spot most amazing aroma baking waffle cones lured instantly sold

the presentation gelato behind glass fun done obvious humor honestly adds appreciable value anticipation devouring cold creamy concoctions 

but remember we hadnt eaten lunch yet merely teaser rather vicious teaser wanted gelato now managed exercise tiny bit control time being went eat lunch best burger joint ive long while then raced back get fix


the service attentive complete offered samples before could get chance ask seemed neverending patience doling out paid special attention daughter lauren age 2 saying oo icweem every choice freezer case were very happy offer flavor after asking course seemed particularly interested tip service people type service includes cheerfully accommodating daughter sure win moms like over life treating like distinct separate customer exceeding expectations really something wholeheartedly appreciate gelato spot did today

i read other reviews place always long wait we went time were very people so cant attest speediness workers theres long wait were awesome shortno wait though

the ambience gelato spot comfortable little exotic id happy spending hours bring laptop free wifi coffee ice cream warm spring day inviting warm place stay while

i tested flavors were honestly not wowing flavor department caramello cold sweet wasnt impressed means didnt really taste caramel fact tried couple others one sweet cream chocolate chips similarly light flavor another one hazelnuts okay not impressive finally impressed ultimately picked coffee gelato ryan got pineapple lauren got chocolate 

the gelatos texture amazing like smooth river cold coffee left nothing desired made special way so air excluded final product similar high end ice creams leaving dense flavorful experience lower fat than traditional american ice creams no means did feel like missing anything fact felt more satisfied confection than do normal ice creamy choices,4,1

reviews musical instrument museum generally great while kids had fun cant enthusiastic expected

first we had unpleasant interaction experience gallery museum docent singled out threeyearold kids running amok suggested would better family center because using remo drums made kids toys rather than experiencing musical instruments distinction still find mystifying wife kathy s wrote about incident own yelp review posted couple days ago ill focus review other aspects experience museum

second upon entering museum we were approached very nice volunteer whom we asked about exhibits good kids only place suggested experience gallery other than banging drums strumming guitars ukuleles hitting couple gongs kids loved anything else oriented kids exhibits interactive buttons simple words graphics big letters maybe instructive models detailing example musical sound generated music read we looked came up short we didnt make through every gallery we found no actual exhibits oriented younger set

the verdict cibo wins

better menu much bigger selection pizzas salads antipasti better prices biancos pizzas either 13 16 cibo has more choices ranging 1050 1650 most option avg 14 cibo offers fantastic variety pizza toppings

the food cibo has never let down tried number things menu makes ordering very difficult these days because everything delicious if had create allstar meal would follows

pesto salad pear salad dammit already tough
antipasto speciale meat cheese olives roasted peppersand remember these balsamic onions cant get enough of
salsiccia best sausage pizza
nutella banana crepe enough said

ive never felt unwelcome restaurant did last night gallo blanco 

my friend dixon were participants mass bike ride through town called critical mass organizer has arrangement clarendon hotel location gallo blanco far we knew mutually understood cyclists were welcome come after ride grab drink use pool

from moment we walked gm over two should make clear neither anything do organizing event almost if thought we were trying pull one over we repeatedly told we were not organizers thought everything agreed upon advance

honestly im not sure difference makes anyway we were just like other patron dressed normally wanted get drink bar mode transportation should not made difference said restaurant if we were not wanted there

the gm could sense annoyance even though interrogating dixon looked over offered buy drink gets sorted out then pointed over corner told just wait over can understand not wanting chaotic scene dining room insulting gm never returned tell had spoken leader

after minutes standing around corner we went bar order drinks while ordering gm walked up said nothing did not make good promise buy drink troubles wasnt really surprising

i wish had even one thing nice say about venue because im sure under different circumstances would good experience 

i doubt driving biking gallo blanco time future,1,1

hate chain restaurants no matter much people tell great feel like im getting something ordinary

this soooo not true roys each restaurant carries vibe city sf roys pulls mission street copper topped bar two level open dining room pulsates city vibe has just enough hawaiian undercurrant remind eating phoenix location has flw influenced touches feels both contemporary familiar

the same goes food ive had half dozen dishes menu while hate say everything good im partial short ribs theirs version compare others against fork tender rich sauce not fatty tough resting bed mashed potatoes manage creamy without being dense seafood specialty seared tuna comes wasabi mustard sauce both complement delicious dish great value order off seasonal prix fix menu last visit we ordered one prix fix two appitizers husband theres more than enough food we were able try wider variety dishes oh shrimp risotto app came two monster shrimps perfectly cooked course we also got seared scallops divine lemongrass cream sauce

places do comfort food well long wongs 

this isnt first date kind place must clause long wong franchise stipulates long wongs needs complete utter dive ive never seen single reputable looking lw establishment dont let appearance deceive long wongs diamond rough

the piece de resistance every long wongs chicken wings id like believe nowhere else planet could find more perfect blend crispy saucy tasty wings ive never had wings anywhere else came close being good ive tried most flavors favorite honey mustard perfect blend sweet spicy sticky goodness other great flavors teriyaki honey bbq honey hot medium 

ive had deep fried zucchinis mushrooms corn dogs foster farms theyre delicious

a dozen wings 78 bucks isnt bad deal ive done larger orders family gettogethers work potlucks wings consistently get rave reviews if want good wings youre not going find anything better youll only end up paying more save yourself trouble go long wongs

id recommend phoning order ahead time otherwise can 10 minute wait make sure correct location

if can get over fact restaurant looks like actually shack youll delighted serve up certainly worth try doubt theyll disappoint,5,1
wife were mood little mexican dining tonight so we decided give blanco try 

blanco had everything going we got we found parking space right upon driving we were seated big semicircular booth offered great view people watching we were intrigued menu 

we really enjoyed atmosphere modern tres chic feel counterbalanced whitewashed wood ceiling giving place ambiance part beach part scottsdale 

as others said food quite good slightlysweetyetspicy salsa arrives bowl freshly fried tortilla chips very good slightly reminiscent border used serve just not sweet we opted margaritas had blood orange version while stuck traditional blended marg we both agreed were flavorful without being overloaded tequila 

in particular we really liked braised short rib we got cheesy tortilla item think 12 tortilla made into mexican pizza accompanied avocado other veggies delicious 

we also ordered carnitas tacos offered split giving each own rice beans one taco pork tender not fatty gripe often chipotle like tacos were very good accompanied little guacamole sour cream 

so only three stars were things dragging down blanco include 

1 sloooow service judging other reviews doesnt sound if always problem everything moved slowly we were drinks took over 10 minutes arrive after ordering food took almost 30 minutes know service could better start getting antsy waiting stuff after certain point happened we were blanco 

2 warm not hot food manager asked everything we commented pizza wasnt very hot arrived table ill give credit marching back over open kitchen sharing thoughts matter staff would expected hot food guess slow service may had something do 

3 overall food prep were just things could improved example using two tortillas per soft tacos would keep together bit more leaving pico de gallo side would keep people like wife dont eat having scrape off 

one note guacamole two sizes appetizer size 9 side item size 5 we opted smaller size brought out chips plenty using before dinner two people so consider option if want save 4 

well give blanco another try future has right elements earn four stars usnext time just deliver,3,1

the crowd covers wide range depending day time no matter always feel comfortable glam girls not so glam fashionistas wannabe fashionistas mommies fraternity boys hipsters office workers students 21 year olds 60 year olds random hippie rancher drinking pbr rubbing shoulders girls drinking champagne oh douchebags good measure 

josh owner really friendly very accommodating friend recently had birthday party were great about bringing cake making mess place

we ventured over 5th wine weeks ago after buying groupon online 15 bucks 30 worth food havent stopped talking about since were not really wine drinkers craft beer more style so we decided just focus food order much little stomachs could handle heres we got so fabulous

bruschetta next time we go back think want order nothing bruschetta good melt mouth savory soft just around perfect explosion both texture flavor we only got four eight bruschetta offerings apples brie peppercorn steak horseradish tomato basil mozzarella prosciutto fig each every one we tried left mouth watering

5th wine burger we asked waiter about burger said one best burgers has ever had we took comment grain salt since works joint after we sank teeth into juicy beast ourselves we realized right damn good burger well deserving praise fries side were also finger lickin good we gobbled up every last one those perfectly fried taters

tomato mozzarella panini everything thought panini could more crispy outside gooey guts tomato cheese inside one tasty sandwich side minestrone soup hit spot well

i wish other mediocre establishments would observe take notes place run successful restaurant valley food service atmosphere impeccable unlike other places dont make pay valet parking dress like wannabe hipster fit look cool im looking postino,5,1

harmony house cool concept somehow just doesnt work music storeantique store could fun maybe should cut out one half just focus expanding antiques music portion not both

about music selection just okay dont carry big names so dont expect find fender anything do however carry generic items might good kids just starting out guitar drums theyre also little overpriced think because theyre mom n pop operation cant compete chain prices places like guitar center 

the staff always looks if im going steal something minute too find disconcerting more than little strange do look like klepto come on

about antiques eh pretty big selection havent found anything great within dont knowits interesting store definitely worth checking out go elsewhere,3,1

location much larger than tempe location parking still bit issue

we definitely prefer ambience mesa location tempe location perhaps because we could actually see everything clearly restaurant versus darkness tempe store

there also nice large patio equipped heat lamps cooler months definite plus

the only reason am not upping 5 stars we found food portions about 34 size less pasties tempe location strange everyone noticed difference whereas we had ample leftovers tempe location had leftovers mesa location

the size food adequate just not we expected we were still hungry even though we ordered appetizer really unlike us

still food delicious we definitely visiting location again soon

also should noted waitstaff extremely friendly helpful selecting pasties definite advantage over waitstaff tempe location just wanted rush into ordering without offering up suggestions,4,1

just reviewed airways lax squad checking upon landing phoenix airport after another absolute horrible experience cancun phoenix story needed told 

prior departing out hotel cancun airport december 23 2012 catch flight 316 received email airways advising flight scheduled depart 405 now changed 435 figured no big deal 30 minutes we still able make connecting flight arizona lax upon arriving cancun airport mexican staff fast efficient professional knowledgeable even apologized several times flight being delayed bags were taken passports were checked we were way flight no time flat once again airways does not deem going mexico usa international flight so required pay 25 service fee per bag do guys remember reason 25 bag fee came about because increased gas prices several years ago now airlines look another way separate money just like stripper waitress hooters 

upon arriving terminal dealing american staff manning checkin counter just adjacent gate another story 1 person review passengers flights documents customs forms passports caused absolute quagmire line no direction staff line lack staff caused flight due depart 435pm depart 510pm does not seem like big deal add into mix basically everyone flight connecting another flight big deal add land phoenix go get passport checked go baggage claim retrieve bag go through customs recheck bag then go through tsa screening again ie shoes off whole 9 yards every minute counts 

our flight takes off stated above 510pm once again 4 hour 45 minute flight no flight entertainment well inflight service once again being horrible 1st class flight attendant hitting 1 passenger entire flight rest flight attendants onboard did best avoid eye contact meant would walk past even if had hand raised air trying get attention 

what biggest fear during flight besides crashing blowing up would rank top fear smelling smoke smell something burning girlfriend quietly whispered do smell something burning shortly afterwards another passenger said same thing asked flight attendant if smelled something burning flight attendant instead actually investigating said no continued we arrived phoenix safely really more than 1 person saying smell something basically ignore plane really

we arrived phoenix late did passport check baggage retrieval customs recheck bags tsa security sprinted terminal c terminal airport standards pretty longggggggg way we arrived found out flight 35 holding doors everyone make delayed cancun flight connecting los angeles flight say staff onboard flight nice helpful overall wish could give airline negative 500 stars 

this airline has forever lost customer anyone friends family listen overall experience we had airways never again

i forgot mention we landed phoenix plane sounded like 100 year old rollercoaster everything shook made noise nothing about smooth overhead compartment doors rattled look faces people sitting around were concern airline joke,1,1

confession am obnoxious asian food snob really try take into consideration rate places havent lived china anything really really love eating chinese food 

i also hope convey am still american heart hate panda express truly truly worship excellently prepared orange chicken 

be may instances suspend courtesy toward lessthanperfect food because product received not only poor quality insulting relative price paid experienced received ordering chopstick express

i ordered chopstick express family special roommates incredibly hungry foodie friend mine whom happened over upon reaching orderer refreshing though annoying talking seemed obnoxious teenager being forced take orders whatever water off ducks back quack quack we ordered orange chicken cashew chicken brocoli beef came fried rice egg rolls supposed come crab puffs were not delivered felt almost insult

all food we received lukewarm best cold worst chinese food can hold nuclear temperatures dont think snobbish assume delivery people can afford invest proper traveling method must admit major problem fact took nearly hour delivery person get means assuming food left fresh spend halfhour uninsulated dont believe ill get sick food considering being served very hot food clearly industry standard still seems sketch best disgusting worst



i digress rate food follows

orange chicken pieces orange chicken were about size mediumsized chicken tenders were then covered weak breading fried unevenly covered tolerable orange sauce only saving grace dish came deeply compacted chinese takeout paper box problematic dish because chicken essentially came out giant clumps 

brocoli beef easily best dish only reason advantage brocoli tender though strangely bitter beef chose use akin stew beef really thick fatty cut used crock pots stews because capacity cook ever ever amen resulted incredibly large chewy chunks gotta admit panda owns brocoli beef chopstick express could take pointers sauce decent enough yet ultimately forgettable

cashew chicken offensive bland strange sauce seemed more like cream chicken than savory peppery sauce am accustomed ate maybe two cashews share boring interesting note presence noodles dish despite fact we were also given rice peas peas 

white rice nearly impossible mess up only exceptional worthy meditation average rice though served essentially room temperature dried rice out

fried rice shocking case read review chopstick express please take note fried rice sealed distrust food safety practices fried rice cooked fast hot because quickness cooking never dries out looked burnt literally burnt seasoned something both bland dark holy hell fried rice should not appear dried out burnt dark chocolate 

egg rolls dont trust these were almost cold touch

crab puffs not present order those favorite d

summary steer clear away place costs advantage living so close mekong plaza means not being terribly far away decent chinese vietnamese food feel like disappointed tongue attempting branch out if these strange congruencies arent addressed management chopstick express worry like happened lose crucial local business forced close dont know maybe offday opinion if something takes hour get place drive 10 minutes tops better sparkle wow chopstick express disparaging food disturbing distance food safety respectability excessive delivery time means never eat again,1,1
never disappoint taste bit pricey fun treat family take home eat patio,4,-1
im going rate one starwise if werent extremely busy night cause otherwise wouldnt stand chance

we decided go monday night run really great special bistro burger fries 3 thirty minute wait table we stuck around we ended up being seated fairly quickly outside patio could easily hold about five six more twotops took five minutes anyone even come over table once server did arrive acted like nobody knew we were even apologized being transparent we put order because time blind grandmother gluten allergy could figured out wanted food arrived had left out sauce said included after server dropped off seemed disappear after finishing had go inside retrieve bill so we could head out yielded another strange circumstance standing literally foot servers face while rubbernecked around asking bill mean literally had put face line vision get guys attention foot away had feeling whole time server pissed we ordered special even though we tipped accordingly

i feel like experience wouldve much better if werent so busy food really good once arrived cooked order atmosphere really pretty cool nice setup flat panel tvs monday night football seemed little pricey said quality pretty good 

overall would say would good place check out if had one more experience like one probably would skip other places area,3,1

the atmosphere small crowded small dance floor couple pool tables dont expect get one tvs playing various sports guess qualifies place sports cafe 

the service omg we had one beer each line retarded over 30 minutes tab out no line sight just people crowding together trying get front line oh lol bar tenders total morons one complained guy next about crappy tip other argued customer about whether ordered rum cokes redbull vodka guy had already made rum cokes pissed got wrong weirdos

isnt experience staying experience working here

i really loved job worked incredible men were inspired passionate about do ben bethel andre bonhote william reed made job much more than job despite various downfalls hotel experienced made great leadership team could absolutely pull together come out ahead

working front desk great job young creative person wants learn hospitality flex talents learned schoolother properties wouldnt give creative personality freedom wish scheduling flexible job challenging provided great catapult career path

as far property itself concerned attracts really diverse crowd means every day grab bag emotions one day can alarmingly overwhelming bloodboiling like first day we were overbooked guests we were getting had cancelled flights very curt beyond rude staff usually next can culturally fulfilling flatout honorable like getting free tickets rolling stones sincere thank long term guest brain surgery credited quick recovery incredibly attentive staff

the jackofalltrades aspect made leave retrospect hourly jobs end up being like,4,1
ive actually had great time anytime ive come
the best part definitely isnt crowded
considering jw marriott almost right across street think awesome place someone vacation staycation
the restaurants higher end offer happy hour probably favorite kona grill location love mellow mushroom pizza 
the froyo place mojo little more unique than cookie cutter froyo places around town 
blue martini very fun place go also very unique phoenix if like live music place
i love not pretentious places scottsdale still has mature classy atmosphere
not really place seen not everyone looking anyway

great place special occasions if do happen fortunate enough large budget dining 
the shopping lack thereof theres no shortage shopping general anywhere phx

i cant believe no one mentioned fact street called high street,4,1

the location great do really nice outdoor seating menu obvious trite drinks follow suite bit overpriced not too terrible old town economics am sucker themed places locales something tickles fancy something stands out bungalow nice clean somewhat indefinable just lacking certain something 

overall dozens better options old town area wont missing out if happen bypass bungalow,2,1

we ordered anitpasto speciale really good although roasted red peppers were overly done mushy we had trouble picking pizza waiter very helpful told were individual sized pizzas since we split antipasto platter we could share one we ordered salsicca pizza came tomato sauce sausage mozzarella really good thin crust pizza crust crispy had little char actually tasted like fresh baked tortilla like mom used make 

we did room desert so we each ordered own crepe thinking would single rolled crepe we should shared one because were big pizza ordered nutella mascarpone crepe good girlfriend ordered nutella banana crepe delicious

we definitely back again another romantic dinner oven fired pizzas fresh imported italian ingredients reasonably priced cant beat,4,1
found delicious bubble tea scottsdale so far ive had taro thai tea flavors both were incredible delectable flavors not too sweet loaded tapioca beads literally least one every sip decentsized smoothie thats right serve tea almost smoothie milk ice least hope milk not cream ice cream case ignorance definitely bliss whatever slightly frozen consistency absolutely perfect makes very refreshing beverage hot summer night 

okay enough gushing about boba onto food thai red curry tofu vegetables spicy excellent had pay extra buck tofu vegetables these separate options well worth tofu came nice little pieces were easy eat chopsticks lightly fried like okay so not health food delicious 

i also tasted green curry fried rice according server normally two spiciness levels above red curry we were able order toned down bit dish didnt look too appetizing honest pretty white so wasnt expecting much flavor mildish green curry really delivered plenty coconut curry flavor not too much spice kept stealing bite whenever mouth got little too overwhelmed spicy red curry 

this great place reasonably priced thai japanese food if nothing else stop bubble tea latte go one star deducted bland ambiance food has plenty flavor,4,1

my meal amazing love pesto chicken sandwich should probably ask extra side corn mixture next time because just so tasty caesar salad had chives sundried tomatoes alonf delicious parmesan crisps croutons halfsandwichsalad meal so large ended up taking half salad go two dinners less than 10 awesome 

even better than service must take pride employees hire because three girls were working were incredibly helpful made restaurant feel more fullservice than fastcasual now if only market bistro would open up spot midtown id even happier please pretty please,4,1
seems like everytime come see someone know never see anymore good sign place popular watering hole mill

ill say only negative beginning im not huge fan long narrow space crowded extremely difficult weave through bar height tables get restrooms

that being said id recommend stop bar golf experience down mill drinks pretty average good decor flat screens walls see place more late night destination than pool hall weekend nights outdoor patio tiny fine dont smoke

overall havent had negative experience yet mainly im giving 4 stars nice place come friends,4,-1

ajs located intersection val vistabaseline nice shopping area called dana park village square same shopping center variety retail shopping options great casual restaurants like pei wei cpk five guys burgers ra 

back ajs customer service good most employees helpful courteous

overall likely revisit ajs next special occasion sweet fix,3,1
so before moved manage new sacks location west side had put time university hardy locale putting cornish pasty co ridiculously close proximity myself other happy hour enthusiasts happened work still call over location see if anyone wants give excuse make drive across town meet black velvet hello name kara im unabashed alcoholic 

so if youre following along we meet pasty co ill already full sacks sandwich soon smell baking dough simmering spices ill perusing amply stocked vegetarian section menu trying decide between three favorites mexican rosemary chicken tikka masala man alive cant drink place thats got such great pubstyle atmosphere not great pubstyle ale thats only complaint about place am compelled eat hearty drink hearty merry until about burst seams 

managing kitchen myself im continuously amazed can do little space seating area only bit longer wider than kitchenprep area open ogle runs parallel grubbing area enjoy sitting bar spy process trying catch staff eavesdropping loud bar banter love someone mashing potatoes chuckles drunken philosophy sessions 

parting tip mentioned other reviews claim fame rightly so 3 irish car bombs ive seen places charge 6 oh dont forget banoffee pie dessert make own whip cream,5,1
room 123 supposed nonsmoking room however lingering stench cigarette smoke cigarette burns comforter chair internet access painfully slow bed most uncomfortable hotel bed ive ever slept toilet consistently ran night most basic amenities room upon arrival such shampoo conditioner lotion coffee packets etc tv remote took lot figuring out switch over cable dvd player perhaps because im director food beverage large hotel im overlypicky overall very underwhelmed stay not 2star quality hotel view ending positive note front desk staff very welcoming accomodating,1,1
pasta bar last night friend first time service very good we were immediately seated decor pleasant modern 

overall impression pasta bar tasty not cheap would hard get out less than 20 per person we had one glass wine one mexican coke had ask old school sugarcane flavored coke we used get 70s two pasta entrees 15 each total 47 no dessert no appetizer although give these small tasteless bread sticks package gratis snack while waiting food came out quickly although werent busiest thursday night had shell pasta started o cant remember name now second bottom entrees menu sausage dining companion had gnocchi both were tasty although im generally not fan gnocchi really very good 

in terms getting into restaurant parking area back could make harder find found weird had basically walk through asu parking lot get side entrance then into restaurant itself 

overall id give 3 out 5 stars prices would deter going back time,3,1

highly recommended sure only thing wish had decent website twitter thing isnt helpful oh bring flashlight,5,1
update ach du lieber other day change came town made cry drift no longer carries sierra nevada ugly ugly thing know present im not sure proceed suppose theres always fat tire youve warned



drift offers decent beer wine selections pleasant atmosphere inside decor bit like being disneyland works well food interesting enjoyable food drinks can get pricey pay atmosphere one way another 

as others before pointed out service place stinks more often than not also tendency turn off misting system patio crank up firespewing tiki torches too early leaving puddle sweat during hot months turn back though request 

drift looking expand patio into parking lot add waterfall designs look pretty cool seem include cabanalike havens more private enjoyment remodel seems wynn las vegas vein waterfalls lighting etc

bottom line if patience poor service cute girls drift offers plenty enjoyment,4,1

short version

1 confirm room location decent if using aaa discount
2 visit during seasons youre able take advantage waterpark ammenities fee least 25 added daily room charge do check out fitness center class schedules
3 if available costco sells az grand resort giftcards discounted rate use these pay room spa packages dining venues sadly these giftcards werent around stayed 

long drawnout version grab cup caffeinated beverage choice

stayed two weeks back january 2008 while builder did repairs ceiling luckily aaa coverage able get discounted rate room inviting tastefullyfurnished we enjoyed comfortable downfilled bedding however disappointed location rooms building had feeling we were only ones lodging wing construction going entire length stay noise not audible room while doors windows were closed we would always inhale airborne particles fumes walk through dust mud paintencrusted areas way room id sure confirm nicer location before secure room especially if youre using aaa card id give 1 2 star rating if basing review solely room location

during stay dined latitude 30 fantastic halibut dessert dishes phantom horse grill 9 french toast made simply breads funky monkey cinnamon bread artisan cinnamon bread battered raspberry cream great hot crispy first time around hohum warm soggy second time dinner good hope can find photo post soon think read somewhere lat 30 now closed hope reopens soon

i also took first two yoga sessions enjoyed both most other members hold memberships resorts fitness center so one does not need resort guest use amenities also during stay resort able do first hike ever one may sign up twohour long hikes fridays saturdays via fitness center happened only one signed up hike so youd think wouldve cancelled however called up beforehand let center know way turn called up instructor so shed time greet since werent anyone else hold up group we were able finish hike normally took two hours about 90 minutes found formidable hike made dangerous wearing crosstraining shoes slipped stumbled couple times lugging around rollaway backpack housing heavy bulky laptop easily 15 20 lbs

note price room does not include 25 per day ammenities fee automatically added whether not use ammenities fee includes use fitness gym jacuzzis saunas poolwater slides too cold swim indeed pool area closed whole length stay so better believe made use fitness center included yoga other classes such spinning aerobics signed up tai chi class too instructor didnt show up so regulars tried go like watching blind leading blind so gave up after about ten minutes headed gym instead

landscaping beautiful especially night treelights transform area into wonderland come happy hour andor dinner then go walk after youll visit believe it

fyi sure do checklist items minibar suggest even take photo so proof did not consume anything front desk tried charge missing aspirin soda we dont drink soda even though informed missing pills within moments entering room charges somewhere around 10 two tablets 12 oz soda were quickly omitted total

ps case youre interested whole foods sells simply breads funky monkey about 10 loaf price increase better deal buy make own french toast home if ask ajs fine foods may offer bread well,3,1

ive eating cornish pasty company since shortly after opened ive consistently impressed

their menu constantly expanding every single pasty ive tried has amazing only veggie pasties havent tried outside original traditional ones though rosemary chicken pilgrim favorites theres no need side dishes appetizer breads anything since every delicious bite need comes wrapped up neatly eggbrushed pastry pocket fresh out oven exactly right amount food

the owner extremely friendly knowledgeable cool fella hes always looking ways make business better hes chosen great crew meet increasing demands growing hot spot since everyone works nice downtoearth ive never seen single employee lounging wasting time there

what do really really well 1 food including salads desserts 2 beer selection incredible full tasty imports domestics both tap bottles 3 prices excellent 4 decor sleek modern complete classic rock playing quiet yet audible volume

what could improve theres very little room parties 4 theres plenty counter space handful tables 2 custom table 3 thats kind neat small area back used smaller tables now one large table parties 4 now take up whole area could seat up 8 making awkward other big parties coming plus cant cut through tables sit bench side booth anymore scoot down length table then push everyone out again if get up reason very small fault considering everything else about place incredible

overall one tempes best little restaurants whenever im not craving food particular location pasties become default food whole household theyre always tasty we just never get tired move out state soon places weve eaten 10 years miss cornish pasty company most,5,1

let preface review fact im chinese know rice

so after meeting next door hava jave review place follow friend wandered over zen32 10pm snack

boy mistake normally eat up celsius desert ridge so thought id get same food down compare 

a couple rolls we ordered

viva vegas roll
caterpillar roll

the service just fine honestly even if had angelina jolie serving food naked food would still crap rating would still uno star

the rice seemed like dayold rice clumpy honestly dont know sushi chef takes clumpy rice puts into roll so anyway due clumpiness rice vegas roll loosly rolled so fell apart tried pick up

the caterpillar roll tasted super bland very hard do because includes so different ingredients like eel faux crab avocado cucumber eel sauce not only did taste bland also poorly rolled 

again service nice might want bring own sushi if youre going eat,1,-1

parking can pain though only offer valet parking lot isnt very big would recommend parking heritage square parking garage monroe if youre heading south 7th street turn right monroe go about block park structure dont forget parking ticket so can get validated though if youre waiting more than 3 hours table exceed validation stamp sometimes can find metered parking street monroe if after 6 7pm believe parking free,4,1

first wants dine huge burger while staring huge mural cow face not makes feel bad probably big reason am fan chicfila eating chicken while staring cow awesome anyway decor cool enough other than giant cow watching eat cousin 

on food 1013 burger seems standard these days upscale burger joints so didnt really bother if came side would perfect so roommie want get good taste everything so we shared options turkey burger glorified baconcheddar burger double truffle fires zucchini fries mint chocolate shake 

1 turkey burger probably best ever had perfectly cooked great flavor seasoning toppings were great cabbage rather than lettuce genus idea 
2 baconcheddar burger meh could gone without ever having thing life first we asked cooked medium showed up bun bloody mess would call rare bacon thousand island dressing battled death neither won way too over powering such dominating burger over wouldnt order again ever 
3 truffle fires do f up truffle fries damn near impossible were great could tell were freshly cut were served awesome aoli get em 
4 zucchini fries blech almost sent back just get out face looked awesome tasted worse than original cheerios batter sucks soaked up oil fryer were soft noodles tried make myself eat 3 couldnt take anymore 
and finally 
5 mint chocolate shake okay most generous way way too much milk added so within 5 minutes had morphed into sloppyslushywatered down concoction bored flavor alone great texture disappointing stick diner know do right 

i say staff great very friendly were take care need we had food itself only ever back once every other month turkey burger craving,2,1

 after chef introduces himself kitchen aides ha we go over menu prior getting hands dirty
 note not lot dirty hands had heres youre split up into 3 groups each group approximately 4 x 6 table sharing ingredients one so each dont get own cheese meat get one plate ingredients kind pass around create makings part one dish would thought theyd least each couple prepare item difficult share because theres not lot go around ingredients premeasured placed table so really do dump these little ramekins measured ingredients into bowl mix 
 bowl mixed ingredients then handed chef finishes mixing together creating dish while explaining tips useful sure felt gyped handson part class wrongfully expecting 
 might suggest if take class grab table right side classroom because bring out portable gas burner table if youre melting sauteeing searing otherwise rest crammed around one stove up front jockeying position see potatos doing
 class wouldnt complete without obligatory sponsors so items being used class conveniently available discount out store 
 after chef prepares courses youve occasionally mixed ingredients team send out store 15 minutes so while cook everything then come back eat little black chair look food damn good we had no complaints just really overpriced opinion action allowed us

i may someday feel urge take another class see if different 60 150 per class difficult talk myself into that

the food very tasty exactly expect traditional peruvian cuisine 

the prices however were far too high given portions 1350 loma saltado had 3 oz meat best price would say wheres beef 750 chicarrone pescado con yucca also way too skimpy portion size least much better value than saltado 

lunch two 2 glases chicca morada fishyucca appetizer two plates loma came 43 tax tip way too much spend lunch we were only ones restaurant entire time need lunch menu

long time ago galaxy far far away oh wait wrong story does seem like long time ago first read were closing beloved chez nous put up yet another transplant grocery chain bitter say least best stories happy endings chez nous found new home fe happened new guy block

i love having fe so close home not perfect pretty darn close someone single loves cook yes watch dates thats mostly because dont 54 days worth back stock just enough keep shelves covered therefore constantly restocking new items thus lovely discount sticker seek find game like play

and no im not huge fan plastic packaging fills recycle bin convenience checking out noted arik b makes things well easy

a couple things really like about store
1 premade products dont really use intended eg wild mushroom soup isnt exactly thing base gravy makes incredible pot roast
2 5 coupons get every week can easily spend required 20 fruits veggies every week so not go discount
3 special shelves up door feature really nice organic herbs can add garden flowers give table little color watch these because discount killer prices

the store always clean bright generally enough staffers around provide assistance needed pretty decent hours more could want neighborhood grocer,4,1

friend mine recently invited join birthday dinner fogo initial thought am going able eat assured salad bar banging so alas we arrive woman hit up bar while we waited peeps got really great dark beer tried go outside box ordered melon martini terrible didnt want send back cause kind own fault bartender however noticed full glass asked if something else could get thank sir got glass malbec instead great friends arrived we were seated like whirlwind craziness after server twirled over explained super fast place worked about went around asking we wanted drink got lady called sirannoying clearly woman whatev stuff happens sometimes youre high meat fumes after done drink order we got up grab salad now know place meat house if youre gonna charge 23 bones salad bar please make great grabbed lettuce started walking around see else wanted were these huge asparagus piled high so grabbed then grabbed green beans huge beet slices broccoli too went dressings kind disappointed were ranch caesar looked tasted like zesty italian kraft boo everything looked really good nothing seasoned mean appreciate being given option season own items plain bland everything want flavor people

modern steak scottsdale 7014 east camelback road youll know better scottsdale fashion square aka bmws overflow lot modern steak part fox restaurant concepts known highly acclaimed eateries bloom olive ivy north greene house et al im usually not corporate food guy fox rc knows hell doing so board giving modern steak try

dinner 

the restaurant big very bold lots bluesilver accented whites browns decor very busy works bar area nice size just enough flat panels satisfy curiosity games without spoiling aesthetic restaurant seating main dining area varied tables long booth bench seats corner booths smaller tables mimic eating outside youre really mall personally id take pass having people watch eat walk back donating kidney exchange new duds barneys 

the wine list fairly small restaurant caliber maybe 30 wines total almost available glass most bottles range about 2x 3x retail prices idea reserve list consists two wines both 35 glass both very good wines then again 35 glass should settled glass kunde syrah 10 fruit forward syrah ca central coast has nicely rounded tannins smooth smoky finish 

those thinking menu about red meat surprise lot seafood dishes available lovers cow wont upset modern steak does live up name about dozen beef entrees unsurprisingly entrees mostly come without sides so extras want la carte spied parmesan truffle fries amongst sides knew immediately would part meal we ordered

poached wild caught shrimp simply amazing four colossal shrimp cooked perfectly then chilled served ginger infused cocktail sauce small herbs maybe micro arugula perfect start meal 

beef short rib red wine jus horseradish gnocchi very well executed dish short rib very tender just melted mouth gnocchi were cooked perfectly sauce had just enough horseradish without overpowering plate jus perfect accent dish mixed well horseradish sauce also split order onto two plates without being asked always plus 

parmesan truffle fries these kind speak themselves thin cut fries married truffle oil parmesan cheese perfectly crispy just delight pop mouth come house made ketchup heard could think chevy chase vacation ooooh real tomato ketchup eddie ketchup much better than still seemed lacking we ended up getting side homemade ranch dressing dip instead nothing high class table

sauteed asparagus parmesan we were lacking greenery table so we also ordered side asparagus cooked ok seemed little bland also cut spears into 2 inch pieces doesnt hurt flavor looked odd pretty forgettable side dish 

final take

modern steak continues trend high quality restaurants run fox rc food choices solid service very good location great so probably keep themselves pretty busy between mall crowd people walking over old town back because want try burger can order restuarant go window access inside mall menu options not cheap feel get quality meal money 

overall grade b very good

quick review great food service ambiance however not cheap helps eat something beforehand else youll quite hungry poor leave 

i received coupon free pitcher sangria iruna consolation prize terrible breakfast over easy sat coupon about 6 months no expiration date until decided one day no coupon 32 value should go unused 

i asked around those had before urged eat something beforehand wife spent over 100 we went one acquaintance proclaimed starving we left good though other comments were similar so grabbed sandwich chikfila before heading restaurant

id made reservation two were seated immediately very large ushaped booth required sit next each other so we could talk clearly worked well since we were sharing everything free white sangria delicious gigantic we left least couple glasses unconsumed end evening

we split four dishes applegrapefruitfennel salad gazpacho calamari scallops were cooked flavored wonderfully though plates were small were not minuscule microscopic id say if go empty stomach 4 plates would probably enough per person had not eaten before probably would ordered couple more items

although we had small order saturday night no point did feel like we were being rushed server knowledgeable polite food came promptly also booth far wall restaurant so we got peoplewatch soak atmosphere place quite pleasant

thanks coupon bill almost 50 less than would otherwise given averages around 10 per plate ready drop serious cash if youre large group hungry companion

gone alchemy copperwynd times over years always loved ambiance setting views amazing whole concept great resort spa etc 

they recently reopened after suffering down turn economy we were very excited back stayed resort five times past several years running great specials prices

we decided go year thanksgiving brunch buffet had thanksgiving twice before 

after making reservations we arrived specified time were seated out outside side patio far crowd okay cloudy cooler day we asked seated next outdoor fireplace two tables were empty because we asked table side heater we were told only had one heater worked taken waitress asked wait returned told we could move another party coming hour table we agreed we were not offered anything else option moving inside table fireplace perfect not mention warmer protected did start rain hmmm wonder if would let get wet too 

this year food set up far room different other times we were did provide more room foodwell seemed much more sparse than previous thanksgiving just not appealing well presented quality food we had good just seemed something lacking cant figure out perhaps time we were 130 things had picked over believe we did not leave hungry so nice not cook cleanup mess contend with

our waitresshmm so bland unattentive cant even remember name had never seen before although mentioned had awhile very disinterested progress through dinner we had ask several times refills mimosas bus staff did good job keeping up removing empty dishes keeping table clean
overall got impression waitress might pissed off had work holiday perhaps just having bad day if seated wait person again would ask sit elsewhere

we watched exchange between two women were seated even farther away crowd than got heated way out women stopped table told were upset about gratuity fee being added bill buffet waitress very rude about started yelling occurred inside reported women so we did not witness

speaking gratuity being addedi agree buffet we served ourselves if anything bus boys did hardest part waitress did not deserve charged most time happens usually 18 added we usually tip 20 lose out
our total bill thanksgiving dinner 142 both kind high side we enjoyed day meal most atmosphere each others company,3,-1

went business trip coworker tried out had least one following
sapporo can ever bad served very cold thumbs up
green tea good good service refills also
edamame good right amount salt
miso interesting wooden bowl wooden spoon tasted good tho
yellow tail salmon tuna albacore uni fw eel kampachi nigiri good stuff those also yasu style nigiri types good usually involves ponzu top
spicy tuna softshell crab roll ssc great

service pretty good sushi also good bar full wish could eaten sushi chefs were friendly talkative people bar unusual least compared la base quality fish outside whatever ponzu soy wasabi other ingredients were pretty good wouldnt say 5 stars since generally judge place wholly food give 45 failing rounded up,5,1
whenever visit breakfast place begin ordering entree pretty basic menu visited good egg location twice both times ordered same thingpoached eggs bacon toast potatoes both times really disappointed first eggs were not poached were nearly hardboiled no runny beautiful yolk dip toast someone wasnt watching pot bacon good bit salty side toast little cold side already buttered something potatoes looked like diced frozen type were just warmed up second time did say something waitress well cashier although nearly finished meal offered eggs cooked again nice so would actually add star nice service last pricea basic breakfast coffee over 11 come ill never return restaurant breakfast especially can go orange table also dogfriendly people friendly uses top line locally grown ingredients basic twoegg breakfast 8 know poach egg ot also provides homemade breads other great breakfast items

sometimes youve had hard week lots issues big quality review friday mental equivalent limp dish rag just needyou just need words unknown hipster chillax commiserate travails modern work life peers hannys comes ideal lunch spot

my office building close downtown tempe so hannys bit out way if drive instead take light rail parking driving downtown phoenix adventure unto itself if get before noon walk greeted world dark leather tones gently playing classical music lack artificial lighting so prevalent modern workplace waitstaff know efficient helpful not overly intrusive distinctly remember waiter did not feel need come over every five minutes ask things were going instead quietly came around refilled drinks greatly appreciated

i had roast beef sandwich layering one two thin slices ribeye delicious saltysmokey bacon fried egg ciabatta bread wonderfully soft hugged sandwich like loving mother hugs beloved child creating most delicious amalgamation flavors noshed through sandwich little driblets egg yolk falling like summer rain onto plate saw dining companions might just thought messy eating

the blt quite popular among dining companions though somewhat disappointed no one went blt supremo has addition sliced hard boiled egg provolone cheese egg time lunch sandwich seems bit out most peoples culinary interests except hard like fearless yelper others had rocket salad seemed involve large amount arugula though friend seemed enjoy another had chopped salad myself had small side salad lemon vinaigrette wonderfully subtle fresh distinctly remembered commenting much enjoyed it

so exhausted after tough week office political infighting ate delicious sandwich laughed joked peers had ice tea regularly quietly filled up while hearing ebullient strains classical music underscoring experience felt despair drain out willingness go back next week into office fray blossom once again 

okay so four starsobviously loved so not five well dont feel ive truly experienced place like one until ive had happy hourdinner experience feeling place like really shines sun has not only down down loooooooong time especially since serve food till 1 am last pour 130so time finish drink still make last light rail fact having dinner other friends tonight put future itinerary until then happy eating fellow yelpers,4,1
needed oil change reeeeaaaally badly know honda those things can run gas fumes 30 miles oil resin months had had ok experience dannys family highland free wash oil change doesnt love that

but checked dannys site saw no promotion wash didnt want drive out way nothing checked yelp jiffy lube had best rating could expect oil change place up road work downloaded coupon thanks tip kym way

pull tell guy want signature change includes window wash floor vacuum mentioning 5 off coupon said were already running special 13 off 35 price so said aok cowboy 

i wait about 810 minutes small waiting room bonus having phoenix magazine stack muscle car monthly oil today antennas weekly look just because im getting routine maintenance car does not mean im into cars

i get pulled into garage area spiel everybody dreads surprisingly short nonpushy im glad dont drag over engine anymore thats totally lame do note tried tell right front blinker left back blinker license plate lights were out had just gone checker replace left front blinker light went through extensive light checking so found news odd kept saying much kept insisting about ask see myself calls out another worker hey honda lights jeep other guy says jeep however no other car place hmmmmmmmm

ok so pay up 24 altogether tax fee something added go back into waiting area while finish up decide use bathroom lost two stars up until then quite possibly fourstar experience wait two stars bathroom ask oh just wait

the bathroom filthiest thing seen life ive raunch truck stop pee holes literally piss bowl get closer shit not pun intended four shit smears bowl well yeah counted two rolls tp hanging out top dispenser each one square left realizing need sterilize hands just walking into mess discover no soap paper towels not very surprising well hair clippings over sink like guys trimming moustaches break unfreakingbelievable am still haunted bathroom experience

can say hasnt already said so ill keep review fairly short 

my husband split vegeterian pizza very delicious big pieces veggies tasted pretty fresh crust very good

the service weird friendly first weird one servers asked if had wine list served wine spoke so quiet barely heard did say would check then disappered minutes reappeared only walk right about 10 minutes later owner think owner came asked kind wine liked time had changed mind

i would say only draw back small place we were seated right next kitchen felt kind cramped 

other than very much enjoyed pizza look forward ordering again lasagna sounds very tasty so would like try out sometime,4,1

after just one visit think can confidently say place has going lots hipsters filling bar has ups downs great people watching unless forced interact then not so much bar also very loud crowded can make having conversation dining mates challenge could however park myself solo watch show music cool mugs beer were frosty priced right nice see local beers tap kiltlifter ftw

the wide open rehabbed salon has welcome warm feeling server almost fixture same warmth casual yet helpful no pressure order turn table quickly busy saturday night

sampled arancini three slightly larger than golf ball size orbs crisped perfection placed atop just right amount pomodoro sauce crispy outside cheesy warm arborio rice centers very tasty

also sampled hand tossed pies smoky just nice combination smokey meats non typical ricotta salata cheese think really surprised tend shy away non traditional toppings spicy chicken loved one spicy good amount juicy well flavored chicken peperoni pie also tasty large slices cured meat ample cheese crust chewy nicely cooked even old standby done death over past hundred years tiramisu tasty satisfying interesting twist crunchy sweet pine nut brittle sprinkled top yum

decent pies nice selection beers tap served frosty glasses great service parlor has certainly hit ground running looking forward checking out other menu choices soon reserving star future visits guess earn,4,1

love man movie went see last night theater

so go place because close house really never crowded two reasons place does not get hirer rating

1 usually pretty dirty could use better clean up would even go far say think place could maybe use good remodel also mens restroom always smell like homeless guy pissed floor then janitor pissed bucket used piss mop up homeless guys pissto put plainly smells like pissseriously dudeshow hard piss urinaltake another step closer god damn thing crying out loud

2 dont think ever get over fact price popcorn thing theater marked up 7000 over actual retail quality american cinema today just overall ticket prices fucking ridiculous remember young whippersnapper no one ever walked out movienow see shit timebecause movies suck so badyou feel dumber after watching them

so place get three starsfor being close fact never uber busy not movies suck,3,-1
met couple friends last wednesday night place has calm vibe decor modern strategically placed candleslighting fire pit latin world music playing background give place warm european feel did not get see much inside check out websites slide show

i tried south american beer first time very good we split bruschetta plate also very good 

if want enjoy great place great patio before scorching heat hits then get over bomberos 

i do place again again,5,1
ive going location very regularly several years like concept paying half price other places charge getting better pizza perfect no sheer quantity ingredients not bad seldom line good bad franchise owner workers okay being cut above

the cost buying pizza ridiculous virtually pizzarias ingredients cost couple dollars most charge 20 robbery proving last night bought extralarge blank crust winco lots pepperoni cheese mushrooms onion sauce whole thing cost under 4 fresh madefromscratch pizza

over time cut menu just basics used great takeandbake lasagne fresh salads premium pizza spicier sauce pepperoni however kudos price remaining pizzas has stayed pretty much same

i dont think franchise owner maybe company very creative aggressive location owns very large residential area could do much better than do 35 star rating gets extra half point because convenient cheap service pretty good,4,-1

favorite bakery valley sun nuff said 

unfortunately used live surprise az one bright shining star daddys bakery used drive right past almost 2 years hard do place tucked into back small strip stores then one day heard voices head say turn glad did

the first thing caught attention knew right spot painting window thanked not dieting 

this bakery closest found grew up brooklyn ny great selection really hard find phoenix italian pastry items 

get early get italian bread loaves fresh out oven omg nothing better 

the sandwiches really good reasonably priced especially since own homemade bread 

when other day looks like now offer take bake pizza looked really good 

in looking over other reviewers comments please try understand one thing am not making excuses staff new york tend not most friendliest people world get over try product glad did,5,1

wanting chinese delivery bad went nearest onethat delivered didnt expect much even place never ate before not surprisingly golden rice express didnt let down 

the food wasokay ive had better shrimp however both fried separately within house special combo very good delivery super fast said 45 minutes didnt shock disappoint took roughly 20 minutes tipped bigger nice delivery guy said slow sunday night well slow house well wouldnt ordering takee outee

i try detailed possible everything so average really cant add too much especially since didnt visit establishment

overall if absolutely must order chinese food ive had ie im not driving anywhere including superior panda express ill get again only should wait until payday otherwise delivery costs taxes tipping policy ordering 15 might well get payday loan prior ordering,3,-1
going uni going 5 years now location great if student asu live tempe generally no more than 510 minute wait if not immediate service unless beginning school year sorority has formal coming up most do good job relatively quick so great place go if youre lunch break dont day 

they nice spapedicure required 10 15 minute massage offer different services ranging full set acrylics manipedis waxing boast hair salon well 

my only complaint sometimes difficult get across looking manicure do not speak great english so definitely language barrier sometimes need show rather than say want wish knew vietnamese so could understand say each other under breath ill remain optimistic nothing negative about,4,1
agree decor makes feel like youre not arizona made feel like new york 1988 only thing missing were keith haring posters 

its got kind dated toocoolforitsowngood vibe tends make hostile 14 martinis didnt decrease antipathy nor did tiniest fourtop ive ever seen least expected dine waiter literally had remove everything table so four dinner plates would fit

however food much better than expected ordered grilled cheese sandwich several people suggested excellent wife had salad delicious plentiful

service friendly charming if bit inept 

bottom line nice spot good people watching only restaurant scottsdale mall had customers night we were cheap food extremely expensive drinks,3,1
if youre u michigan state fan bar watch game upper deck decent sports bar heart old town scottsdale decent common word describe upper deck food decent drinks decent prices decent space decent game day bar can get pretty crowded so best get before game want watch actually starts order secure seat upstairs area has another bar additonal seating including red velvelt couches ground floor tvs line walls theater tv center wall so if game playing tv perfect 

i typically only visit upper deck game day sense theyve got niche covered because those place packed prepared wait food drinks due crowds if dont mind large crowds decent not always so quick service suggest visiting watch game if possible might want eat before food decent worth checking out other spots first having snack upper deck,3,1
casual comfortable spot old town somebody kitchen knows make mexican foodno doubt server delight right target keeping happy salsa great especially green one tomatillosloved itand tacos were good too no not quiet like typical scottsdale restaurant dont think meant more like restaurantbarcantina kind place fun no attitude among patrons servers loved prices very reasonable too we back soon,4,-1

so ended up pure sushi after meandering through mediocre art fest dont worry andrea wasnt stalking bonnie g needed fed 5 chocolatecovered frozen bananas were not going cut charges 5 bucks one banana anyway scottsdale

but im glad we ate pure particular time place history before scottsdale discovers open business forever lost

atmosphere
given pure everything basically white smooth sleek la not neighborhood sushi bar if youre hanging out scottsdale civic center youre not looking neighborhood sushi bar fits right asia de cuba az88 so take worth also random elevator kenny g music playing longest time little confusing were playing ironic didnt understand if sleek spot dine youre looking it

service
extremely friendly attentive manager waitstaff bussers little jarring seemed 12 staff members every guest no fault own didnt realize we walked opening day least seemed like opening day difference between attitude az88 staff next door like night day

food
i found menu little hokey read we went miso soup hamachiscallion roll 5 unagi hand roll 5 october festival roll soup standard were hamachi unagi rolls however 15 expecting more out october festival roll then again we ordered something called october festival roll while looked pretty drizzled sweet sauce get trader joes chinese one red pepper flakes im finding lot restaurants around valley year using exact same sauce reason anyway we still devoured shrimp tempura spicy tuna avocado im not sure deserved 15 

conclusion
all good experience like 375 stars we were treated extremely well service prompt made bulk star wattage id still go yasu way before great sushi experience valley id come back again maybe more sake small bite than full sushi dinner,4,1
pleasantly surprised grimaldis we came work function lots nibbles course im normally not thin pizza girl thats only kind theyd gotten event actually pretty good good enough might think about ordering ifwhen go again if were more neighborhood know id made back now

weird experience 

up until end everything pretty fine okay mediocre server seemed pretty awesome food filling then things started get bit uncomfortable

as vegetarian ordered veggie tacos come side rice beans rice has chicken broth asked waiter if could skip rice not veg friendly just get extra side beans instead said would aokay

once bill came handed over credit card without checking bill knowmy fault upon reading receipt realized we had charged 3 extra side beans waiter got bit defensive tried explain himself eventually gave pulling out tip money pocket giving 3 cash very awkward straight up taking money like made feel badweird 

without experience place would given 25 3 stars,2,1
place not cleanest has known score pretty low health inspections however love little street tacos never had problems myself id say sanitary getting street taco mexico ive had 

they kinds tacos beef chicken pork al pastor goat cow head tongue u name lot other stuff too just get tacos 6 because tiny 

they tvs watching futbol game pool run 50cents 3 video games addition jukebox no ac so watch out summer usually use drive thru

when im finished go one lady pay tells price then ask if can pay credit card says yes so grabs card then afterwards demands points sign pay cash only tip instead card fuck im not tipping anyone merely asking tip especially did shitty job didnt put effort into so no never go again maybe wax begs tip then no tip missy,2,-1
place great nyeast coast style italian grocery store offers wide variety pastas sandwiches ive coming since asu days found defalcos good deal money taste sandwiches
i almost always get sausage sandwich baked penne become staples visits recently tried premade pizza dough 199 only requires rolling out baking takes little effort results were spectacular
the only downfall can bit wait get helped now signs up actual groceries quite pricey decent deals anything premade wine pasta sauces deli meats pretty high price scale
this place great place grab bite eat dont buy too much groceries unless looking true italian ingredient make recipe exactly like italy rare item cant found anywhere else otherwise definitely worth stopping least looking around,4,1

first look may seem like hotel may compare standard hotels hollywood downtown los angeles judging photos even promote fact won four star review howard seftel restaurant critic best phoenix since going trip work didnt mind checking out mean not sacrifice points stay something up up wrong idea

first let say should researched further going off site user reviews arrived hotel wasnt very noticeable wasnt noticeable because quick one way street hidden behind other structures rather more fact middle neighborhood surrounded apartment complexes exterior business didnt look very impressive looked like poor girl trying too hard noticed wearing trendy clothes dont look right motel makeover covered old self well best concealer acne ridden 13 year old

there music playing through out hotel did take notice strong consistency marketing select demographic ie young urban chic 20early 30s stepped into room glad see pictures spoke truth expect everything room new furniture carpet had wonderful bed one most comfortable ive slept during business travels only thing complain about room is

1 air conditioner didnt work didnt know work it
2 no pens hotel room yet notepads
3 wifi didnt work great because signal too weak didnt hard wire lan line

as restaurant located within hotel didnt give chance were only 2 people dining even after went out hour drive same people were seemed so dead if wanted eat alone would eaten fast food ordered pizza checked out 24 hour fitness area noticed most cardio equipment out order even advertise then nothing do within walking distance hotel unless wanted stand corner wait score dime sack get soda gas station

overall can see message hotel trying send think wrong location long way go see really really long road ahead them

for location because location everything must give 2 stars

will not see there

am really conflicted about lustre bar outdoor bar located second floor hotel pool beautiful plenty comfortable seating throughout views stunning 

the drinks expensive 10 pop handcrafted cocktails whatever means often feel too strong one hand probably good because 10 wont need drink want enjoy drinks so dont know can also order food while up blue hound kitchen cool keep mind though limited menu 

we came nye party bit train wreck 

the good cover charge reasonable 20 music great wasnt one particular genre so something everyone complimentary buffet light items 

the bad wasnt enough heat lamps so groups people were often huddled under even saw people blankets really service horrendous absent were only 3 girls working grounds point ordered drink waitress we didnt see 45 minutes plus never got drink ordered one point sniped really busy never came back spoke employee about handled if we wanted go bar instead half hour wait get drink awful really surprised little staffed nye party 

again overall am conflicted about feel about lustre bar think still has growing pains,3,-1

gf heard so good things about binkleys over years people we know dined reading reviews online we finally decided we had try see stacked up against kai favorite restaurant phx area made reservations friday night memorial day weekend little over week advance since binkleys about 35 miles neighborhood we both live we decided make weekend stay boulders week leading up meal we were both so excited we both joked we were getting very little work done due anticipation amazing meal we were going friday night

friday finally came we arrived right time 7p reservation we were promptly greeted hostess promptly seated absolute worst table house bar area right next front door most insulting part hostess tried tell amazing table because vases flowers separated table front door were so pretty grand scheme things not big deal if wow food after we knew reviews atmosphere not strong selling point restaurant

after we were seated we waited good 15 minutes before being greeted server one pet peeves fine dining establishment like greeted promptly server offered cocktail so can enjoy drink while reviewing menu once we were finally greeted we ordered cocktails enjoyed were finally served being first binkleys experience we both decided we would go whole hog order 6 course tasting menu 50ea wine pairing has mentioned may other reviews online meal binkleys consists long parade amuses sadly meal more misses than hits amuses provided more hits

the big hit night summer truffle grits gf ordered hot appetizer both agreed these were amazing unfortunately most everything else relatively forgettable halibut fish course absolutely boring quail meat course quite good not something would drive 35 miles experience again

throughout night service pacing uneven sometimes very lengthy time between courses while other courses were brought quickly while main server perfectly friendly lacked fine dining polish disappeared long periods time especially time check several times over course evening

as wine pairings those were also hits misses pourings themselves were quite anemic long times between courses were several times had finished pour before course even arrived total 100 between two felt wine weak spot evening

the most entertaining part meal gordon ramsayesque fbomb laced tirade chef binkley went point during meal apparently kitchen staff wasnt doing things way letting know quite comical although little uncomfortable other diners around we could clearly hear every word screamed staff

when said done we spent little over 400 tip dinner while certainly wasnt worst meal either lives we both agreed didnt even come near cracking top 20 we were both glad we dined binkleys firsthand experience we both left feeling overrated perhaps were having off night maybe has slipped over years maybe just victim being overhyped whatever case dont think we dining binkleys future,2,1

love idea winery tucked away old town just found delivery little off 

you cant beat ladies night pricing even regular pricing good meant only women save servers establishment kind strange wish samples were little more generous really wish gave new glass each one quick enough grab unused glass second sample first almond champagne interesting pouring another wine into glass would surely tainted taste would expect winery know better also had great view ton plastic water cooler looking jugs filled wine back normal store wine plastic jugs paper covering ceiling one point were playing dark side just plain odd not dont enjoy dark side just little strange winery

the food standard wine bar fare chose cheese plate thought average best cheeses were particularly memorable would preferred if were served something other than carrs water crackers 

the service slow food slow come out odd because place small items really require cooking server also very slow bringing out tastings checking see if we were ready another 

will back umto honest doubtful maybe if happen side scottsdale rd honestly so choices wine cafes probably wouldnt radar,3,1

dont whole lot say about place usually tend write pretty lengthy reviews place think would just like list pros cons half dozen so times ive 

pros
teriyaki bowls pretty cheap
nice size servings
the seating area usually very clean 
they fairly quick getting food out you
the beef really well cooked tender not rubbery like other rice bowl places ive to

cons
everything served styrofoam not too appetizing if youre getting sushi
the sushi way too expensive quality not bad sushi just not worth 10 roll
the staff evening usually 18 im course guessing year olds dont like bothered if theyre cell phones sometimes girls dressed little inappropriately being work thats course just opinion

thats pretty much nothing fancy edible decent price long youre not getting sushi,3,-1

but no waited reviewing copper star each visit hoping would different than last cant ignore things likewell drinks 

two big things dont like

1 fundamentally drinks never very good milk either scalded if someone didnt get message milk temperature rises after turn steam wand off double cup breve means screwed up should make again should not feel cup knowing taste scalded only take sip hand back also espresso shots need pulled accurately using manual machine preferably between 1824 seconds if things calibrated right shot sits forever while get shit together steam milk generally mess around loses body begins quick descent into realm bitterness happens lot cant get americano no crema just looks burned out because shots sat forever were never pulled correctly first place 

2 place looks fine first glance floors always dirty counters condiment bar never wiped down while inside steaming pitchers dont look like get thorough rinse after each usage notice these things bother me

that being said not awful would just rather go lux lola citizen giant even starbucks want love more like urban beans over 7th street both get hopes up dont deliver,2,1
forgot review place before multiple times including just now see skyfall never ending 5 groupon basically get soda iced tea ticket 5 normally 710 ticket 3 soda so not bad deal

you cant buy ticket online wthe groupon theater has recently switched 100 reserved seating can check if theater full not before leave home selecting movie time website then getting reserved seating page itll show seats purchased

the food serve mostly stuff can eat fingers prices seem high portions kinda big like seems intended one person eat alone food itself not really bad not like mind numbingly good either ive never had anything soggy gross like other reviewers had ive even midnight showings

so negatives

with new big releases sometimes take like billion years clean theater out before next showing normal other theaters yes other theaters snacks before walk door means cant sit down order something before lights go out often inconvenient other patrons servers try quiet doesnt always work out way also like other reviews noted office chairs suck led service lights can annoying

tldr buy groupons sit love seats,4,-1

rarely write reviews good bad so shocked experience had share fellow yelppers am vegan wether choice because food allergies besides point opinion firstly mom went grab table no one had come table drinks even after had already parked car came seated over 5 minuets not busy so not empathetic takes over 10 minuets moms fiancé get up ask waitress 

this drama begins
finally comes over point we ready order mom fiance place theirs ask waitress if way get spring rolls without shrimp menu says shrimp vegetables responds dont come shrimp so point out menu tell am vegan replies doesnt come shrimp dont know menu would said just vegetables stuff ask double check grabs menus walks away later comes back drinks menu says cant guarantee dont come shrimp so menu really wanted spring rolls so ask ask manager chef if can make without shrimp comes back tells premade cant make special requests say am surprised premake spring rolls take cucumber salad cucumber roll no mayo please mayo commonly put sushi

then manager comes over did not ask see manager tells mix premade would take long make spring rolls fresh cant make spring rolls without shrimp kidding too long making rainbow rolls back deep frying tempura tell am simply vegan ask would recommend says vegetable roll order no mayo doesnt even apologize cant accommodate just walks away 

she brings out cucumber salad take bite notice has imitation crab cod fish normally now dont even complain tell take back just offer mother am surprised because right before ordered said vegan so strick two waitress doesnt know menu items am not high maintenance didnt complain send back ask taken off bill 

later bring out rolls appears mayo vegetable roll now forgive being worried not trusting competence people working ask waitress if looks like mayo point out looks says thats kinda green avocado so look again am still not sure just say ok walks away could not believe didnt take chef sure completely rude short about knows am allergic eggs shell fish if took said face value didnt challenge shrimp mayo would taken bite spring roll would put shock id rushed hospital if know about shell fish allergies bad peanut allergies rash allergy eggs mayo made egg whites lucky no allergy cod fish didnt complain about cucumber salad either 

now makes worse went loco patron earlier afternoon lunch just super casual sports bar serves mexican food also mac n cheese fries were way more accommodating far less rude made most amazing mexican vegan plate ive had since becoming vegan 8 too so cheap even accidently brought side beans cheese took back took off bill didnt ask just polite were sorry about mistake

i family scottsdale grew up scottsdale worked local restaurants zipps oreganos nypd pizza name am not stuck up bitch whos daddy pays everything complain nothing wrong worked restaurant business know ridiculous could not believe waitress knew nothing about menu manager such chump lived los angeles last 5 years know veganism more common over just ridiculous

i never go again family never go again recommend going were just plain rude wants eat pre made food sit down restaurant least jack box doesnt make till order wtf,1,1

theater remains one last remnants leftover reminder fashion square once wasnt always so posh no fashion square used kinda lowrent rather than fancy pants used packed kids ditching school anchored fuckin sears even used able smoke inside before originally small somewhat openair 3 story building anchored grocery store midlevel clothing department store 

today fashion square more destination tourists looking swanky desert oasis shopping experience place wealthy financial elite escape proletariat masses mall america southwest

given transformation fashion square has gone through clear harkins theater needs redone removed itll take more than facelift theater sticks out like whore church not just contrast mall lives also among other harkins theaters speckle valley one worst examples left 

to honest never very good theater screening rooms tiny clean about well 8th grader cleans room sticky floors empty wrappers layer crud everything could scrape off fingernail crud probably being mixture milk dud coating fake butter flavoring dead skin 

the location awful stuck end food court theres sneak preview everyone line up upstairs walkway mall not best way save spot line if youre handicapped take elevator if theres big movie out somehow everyone wants see shithole spilling out into food court dining area creating traffic nightmare bit mess 

what need do remove theaters expand lobby so people can wait inside could also expand small theaters 5 screens enough actually better use space would fill theaters up garbage then fill lobby hallway cement turn front into cinnabon something,2,1

all can say good writer working them

because not good all


first service decent dennys trained waiters supposed more upscale so just lack basic training know mexican restaurant ie 810 top sat down next waiter stood kids end yelling specials adults other end waiter never told about empty plates left long times ect 

tables bad lacquer finish always feels sticky just grossed out begin every time arm touch table

next salsa so so real runny flavor ok chips were good

got house margarita 8 awful tastes like lime aid bad tequila sat jar sun just nasty afraid order something else bar would think upscale mexican restaurant could make good marg

i had carnitas general ok except ridiculous amount salt used couldnt stop drinking water night after meat so assume marinade used portion too huge

wife had spinach ench should could barely eat said were flavorless no cheese just not good all

try if like big thumbs down,2,-1

the absolute worst thing about 24 hour obnoxious melaleuca executive director named pam talks phone top lungs while elliptical completely oblivious fact not only annoying everyone around also shares personal information about sales team customers hear fact know full name email address phone number names people team thinks aholes because cant comprehend gym isnt home office shut piehole 45 stinking minutes wish 24 hour would ban cell phones melaleuca pam gym floor

lastly just word advice dont ever under circumstances sit those vinyl chairs outside locker rooms dont want know trust people,3,-1

so earth am giving place 3 stars well really 25 honestly food solid middle road tex mex portions were large price making meal had value 650 quesadilla green chilies made can only described worlds largest tortilla had 30 one because folded over still looked enormous wasnt too much cheese enough not feel stingy though accompanying guac pico de gallo not nearly enough magnitude quesadilla we were tuesday night 12 taco night did try mahi mahi taco soft corn tortilla liked dont really like mahi mahi because regularly cooked death tastes like nothing topping made nice 2 treat

recently began reading about benefits raw milk decided give try first time may say took risk read about first not like arent other potentially unsafe things do like driving go get milk anyway went around finally found coop market 4th avenue tucson sells raw milk save dairy about 12 little pricey long story short definitely worth least trying ill continue buy no matter price coming someone previously never considered herself someone likes milk

the first thing noticed really white has absolutely no milky smell taste compared ultrapasteurized skim milk had drinking before researched further found pasteurization actually makes milk taste different so experience indicative noticeable difference makes next thing noticed mild symptoms lactose intolerance experience after drinking regular pasteurized homogenized milk didnt occur third thing noticed wanted more if wasnt poor college student id look into donating help farm something hopefully didnt name save dairy because going out business something

in fact had b1g1 coupon so brought lady along got salad no doubt enjoyed salad however neither thought good value even b1g1 remember chipotle had b1g1 damn good value

unfortunately if youre tempe area should go little further try get table four peaks better value better food if cant wait hit up five guys mill innout 202rural,3,1
first visit swina accident had appt massage swiha mistakenly turned into parking lot next door second time reparations swiha caused close shop move appointments including massage not able enjoy massage much bec open ceilings allowed sorts noises conversations construction noises coming next door etc too distracting

i able experience first mud wrap after first reading about swinas offering back june 08 last friday id say nothing thought would thought id lying bed mud like ive seen european travel logs w slices fruit veggies covering eyes no not cucumber slices im allergic cukes nope no mud bed no sliced garnishes placed windows soul however did get two women simultaneously massage back cassie leg muscles patty woah so tandem massages about asked if standard practice swina cause if could definitely get used no im told got lucky day w students schedules opening up just right moment allow extra luxury if ask think ploy get newbies come back treatments week after week

but lets backtrack bit start beginning after stripping down comfort level topless lying face down massage table requested face pillow more comfort cassie patty proceeded give back leg massages afterwards employed natural brushes over exposed areas allover exfoliation sensations ranged slightly ticklish soothing may tailor pressure exerted asked flip over onto back soon after mud then painted both women another set brushes treatment started go downhill mud applied cold thank goodness heat lamp nearby keep warm after painting back arms legs abs two women proceeded wrap plastic around extremities then again w another wrap already laid top massage table under if suffer claustrophobia body wraps not patty then left cassie help another student cassie then proceeded give second favorite part treatment head neck massage nice after cassie offered give something complimentary facial massage would want one yes thank very much after pampering we were now point again had endure chills while cassie wiped off mud w warm towels requested hotter towels steaming hot poor cassie hands were burning did requested able stave off chills awhile wrap things up cassie followed up w hypoallergenic lotus touch lotion 

my skin felt supple nothing different than id experience after bath home using aveda soothing therapy salts whole experience good most bec cassies bedside manner wouldnt hesitate ask again however dont think id try another wrap swina offers three mud seaweed herbal since id rather not get chilled plus plastic wraps used arent biodegradeable so id feel guilty causing pollution id say tandem head neck facial massages were favorite parts ill just stick w swiha back try other services hourlong facials 30 anyone,3,1

quest enlightenment has taken westerners eastern localesincluding not limited tibet polonnaruwa wat phra kaew now scottsdales own stingray sushi not just food menu spiritual awakening itself proven restaurants liberal use wise sayings ironically zen often associated japan focuses most knowledge gained through personal experience not theory hindsight better

immediately upon opening stingrays door almost always greeted cacophony hardly place one might think enjoy deep meditation would learn restaurant embodies four noble truths restaurants scottsdale perfectly

first space ultimate luxury agoraphobics beware stingrays design may hint asian sensibilitiesbut really more about high rent right sushi bar several dining tables left other kind bar other kind tables outside yet more tables patio if group undoubtedly risk wait despite ive often seated within minutes showing upespecially sushi bar

the next maxim not restaurant destination evaluating sushi joint most important distinction one invisibleliterally well rice treated vinegar regard stingray does fine fish come out stronger fresher than othersbut not yet uncovered pattern 

which brings next truth sex sells take dim dark surroundings add raw meat already makings potboiler stingray like sushi establishments kind goes great lengths milk exotic allure asian culture far askfar enough hire small coterie young comely women serve regardless service skills excellent clueless ignore because amalasa table one 

and then theres last axiom get pay if stingrays not most remarkable cuisine service decorwhat then causes ed hardy army drop unspeakable amounts money within walls yes call crowd scenster may understatement peoplewatching already stated not disappoint

yet stingray does another allure kitchen open until midnight so found myself stopping after going movie only see packed vibrant yet no one disturbs leaving oneself attend ones blissand spicy tuna,3,1
came last sunday pints 3 each highs lows share about place steal word bud light beers had lot drinkability hefeweizen very smooth were no complaints about pilsner ipa vanilla porter nice flavors around

but 5 appetizers were not pleasant im afraid seared ahi sliders looked delicious tasted pretty good wasabi aioli bit overpowering would order again black bean chili fries were just mediocre sounds fancy melted oaxaca cheese top dont taste like anything special cheese quesadilla way too bland cheese lover like myself bruschetta alright bit too different

ill back try entree sometime im not expecting much love cozy patio great beer support local breweries come long stick beer wont disappointed,3,1

easy overlook dated decor reminds old steak houses service so exceptional food dependable up masterful 
our knowledgeable waiter explained most menu gave detail meats were sourced 

we started corn raviolis truffle oil flavors went together well nice size portion two start with

we both thought salad radicchio endive walnuts pears gorgonzola perfect balance taste texture generous portion two share 

my husband had wild boar loin came very rich sauce balance extremely lean meat said sauce little spicy beefy rich well made flavors went nicely addition mushrooms wild boar plate also came buttery mashed potatoes buttery fresh vegetables 

i had scottish salmon seared top prepared almost medium well salmon came red pepper lightly creamed sauce haricot verts asparagus sugar snap peas eggplant vegetables were cooked perfect were buttery chopped raw tomatoes top cut richness 

we shared huckleberry tart dessert had pastry cream less huckleberries than expecting good soon we were ready check bring out these tiny baked chocolate mousse tasted light chocolate air 

a sweet ending
also no problems using groupon,4,-1
intriguing fun ive experienced so far market food counter

the market stocks unique variety foodsand has pretty solid beer wine selection lots local products noticed lots local foods good selection arizona beers too not just standard four peaks offering can find most stores good stuff breweries sedona flagstaff among others

as food counter absolutely worth try pulled pork sandwich top menu reason fantastic sauces hand very good too represent nice variety vinegar based southern sauces standard tomato based midwestern sauces too

definitely worth visit,5,1
restaurant probably has most overrated india eatery arizona went family weekend lunch buffet thoroughly disappointed food stale service really bad

if didnt big pizza front face would thought ordered big serving attitude side screw you

maybe because we came couponbut place had more ego than 15 minute celebrity 

not knock small family owned places usually love going places like because usually get friendly family feel pizza joint located shopping center next albertsons sure wanted make think were eating caviar

things not so awesome
1 whomever answered phone didnt know east west able give directions
2 waitress couldnt give suggestions food
3 cant do half half pizza unless paid extra
4 pay charge if want split plate food
5 attitude attitude attitude
6 tip already included bill

ive never family run pizzeria cant do half half pizza only restaurants ive ever charge split plate food ones youd feel more comfortable wearing dress definitely not one strip mall like one

i swear if two waitresses rolled eyes huffed more than already did probably would fainted lack oxygen vertigo

and last time looked believe old enough do own math tip if were so scared we were going stiff tip maybe should learn little something called cusstoemer surviss

foodwise pizza not best ive ever had fact bit dry side cant say absolutely horrible neither can say heaven wings were much better opinion

for pain drive having dodge eye daggers definite nopeat,1,1

well one not small skinny filled nothing lost hope broken dream small portions shrimp meat if meat most even cheaped out vermicelli noodles lettuce mint more like worst kiss ever got bad enough break up over 

then pho staple vietnamese cuisine first thing anyone thinks about hear vietnamese food well upon ordering food expected delicious heart warming soup well broth flavorless could made better one water bouillon cube dish beautiful though so simple onions jalapeno cut thin can get cilantro chopped roughly taste just not 

the service like vietnamese place lacking place worst server kid spoke no english paying no attention anyone not caring must gotten suckered into free labor father someone equally didnt care about patrons

all visual appeal pho amazing small details ingredients were executed nicely spring roll done poorly can get better one trader joes flavors food lacking aspects please someone give salt pepper cook pho greatness can enjoyed out sriracha hoison we love ruin natural flavor broth place needed bring brown water broth life,1,-1

am pretty loyal trader joes buying most groceries 30 things arent trader joes get about half fresh easy

the good prices fresh easy offers great prices so items combine coupons frequently get paper online 5 off 25 6 off 30 10 off 50 can save lot bucks around holidays even had 12 off 50 readily used

the newly introduced friends card also saves lot money little userdemanding because cant get bonus points unless select website before shopping trip essentially pick total 6 coupons bonus points 3 each two lists specials website then those purchases receive set amount points either x price something like 500 extra points perea sounds complicated really easy long time plan out shopping list use points dollars off next shopping order amassed 500 points more 

they vegetables 99 cent packs also bargain cooler often filled 50 off more items like steaks need cook night salads todays sell date 

fresh easy value

and best part about fresh easy true name

of course like trader joes dont everything list wont find brands youre looking 

but might items cant find anywhere else if youre british excellent selection favorites like bisto gravy must heinz canned beans tomato sauce natch even britishstyle bacon not like american bacon friends porkeaters tell recognize fresh easy owned tesco corporation sure

the service
my visit dominicks night after official opening service tried very hard impeccable surroundings while not perfect charming staff sincere effort put forth made little things like missing napkins bread plates instantly forgivable server drew let know wait staff only had 2 3 tables each very evident personal service we received more weeks experience staff should easily iron out little wrinkles

for main course we both had 9oz filet lobster gnocchi steamed asparagus filet perfect rareplus dark pink center expertly seared juicy
surprisingly lobster gnocchi really stole show im not big starches cream sauces so suggested wasnt particularly excited should dough light fluffy cream sauce not too rich lobster added perfect amount salt texture
after dinner indulged grand marnier while companion ordered tiramisu presented 10 inch tall hunk cake could easily intended 4 people tiramisu spongy light lovely cool custard only subtle flavor rum nice finish excellent meal

recently ate dinner alessias ristorante italiano located 5251 e brown rd mesa yes mesa tucked corner strip mall se corner higley brown roads doors down broadway palm dinner theater smaller mom pop restaurant serves up sorts italian fare 

dinner 

alessias owned run jon shari carr shari does cooking jon kind runs rest show very small restaurant room maybe 30 40 people max inside do patio area well time year bit chilly dining al fresco decor pretty bland just fine local eatery alessias cozy place definitely get personal attention jon 

the wine list nice features italian wines helps authenticity would personally like see focus italian wines still offerings other wine producing areas world wine prices reasonable 15x 2x retail fair number glass we ordered bottle 2003 santome raboso 48 very lush wine rich fruit leathery very well composed palate raboso reminds really good cab sav merlot added rounded structure 

alessias menu offers pasta types would expect liked can also get just about type sauce those pasta dishes also meat seafood based entrees well appetizer selection small choices pretty solid prices reasonable apps being 6 10 larger plates being under 22 under 15 

we split appetizer pasta dish entree rundown items order we ate them


crostini ai porcini these were small pieces grilled bread fresh mozzarella then topped sauteed porcini mushrooms herbs very tasty so much garlic sauteed mushrooms kind detracted otherwise delicious appetizer we still ate good we shared could feel garlic oozing out pores afterwards so knew wouldnt only one warding off vampires evening 

gnocchi creamy gorgonzola sauce dish resulted good newsbad news situation good news gorgonzola sauce very tasty rich creamy nice bite gorgonzola bad news gnocchi were just ok tasted undercooked like pasta too al dente werent bad fresh bread dipped gorgonzola sauce making smile more than potato dumplings were 

pollo erbe two chicken breasts served red sauce rosemary sage garlic onions basil chicken wonderful very moist sauce great would definitely order again came choice salad pasta we got salad if could use way back machine would taken pasta side chicken then bypassed gnocchi salad course live learn

successfully tricked friend into doing hike telling fine people dont exercise let preface saying were young healthy twentysomethings although neither hardcore hikers cmon we wore normal sneakers jeans we managed gasp way top middle rain shower makes rocks very slippery

the first part course would consider hike walking up path eventually walking turns into climbing path turns into maze boulders we overheard people way down saying blue paint continued mark way go rocks we followed rest way up

i wont lie challenging hike quads were very sore next day doable if dont major injuries gogetter attitude note we did hike 50degree weather still needed about 24 ounces water each gloves would helpful definite rockscaling involved view top beautiful climbing down just challenging if not more so than climbing up,5,1

chicos tacos kind queenly sister chain mexican restaurants peppered around phoenix like so grains sand swimsuit clearly several steps up local generic mexican drive through still just not tasty

this fact does not dissuade visiting chicos semikindaregular basis close work wait generally minimal please keep mind experience only reflection typical lunch rush chicos environment atmosphere probably different most other times day imagine observations food hold true regardless hour

a quicktalking girl counter hustle bustle into making order speedily possible then hand slip paper order number we know game goes hang out wait said number called 

if need inandout quickly good time fill up little plastic cups salsa road salsa bar probably 5 6 salsas choose no salsa already included togo order like salsa barits always clean wellstocked salsas good flavor order include meager serving restaurantmade not quite warm delicious tortilla chips

i ordered things chicos okay understand mexican grilled platter entree includes grilled chicken does everything need blackened charred dry point unusual crunch salsa we discussed earlier comes doused copious amount salsa not too bad cant imagine straightup muching without extra step preparation

the rice good cant comment beans because dont eat them

the inside restaurant cute much nicer than usual chain reflete wooden parrots brightlycolored tiles something about inside building makes very loud inside lunchtime not spot sit bring book contemplate mysteries reality newly found adulthoodnot ive know tried thator anything,2,1

know place phoenix institution quite nice inside compared chinese restaurants invited lunch colleague had dined times past

i felt lunch menu perhaps bit overpriced given quantity quality food

i ordered kung pao shrimp 825 spicy dish ordered hot came so mild might well ordered shrimp lobster sauce peanuts thrown were about 10 peanuts 12 cup sauteed green onions about 4 medium sized shrimp go fried rice had nothing egg roll size thumb nice came hot tea

was outrageously priced absolutely not would eat again if someone invited course if choice much better chinese restaurants found,2,1
things considered bianco gets 2 stars only pizzafood considered id probably give 35 4 stars however half dinning experience comes bianco experience terrible basically if dont like wait longer than 12 hrs table should go somewhere else owner purposely keeps place small so wait time always over 1 hour only take reservations 6 more people assuming availability own house next door converted barwaiting area actually even waiting area requires wait order score seat inside otherwise doomed wait 100 degree heat porch 

having eaten bianco am really perplexed always such wait mean pizza pretty decent bang buck really not much better than phoenix chain nypd ny pizza dept only assumption can make phoenix area lacks wellreviewed restaurants so people always flock bianco because has pretty wellpublicized 

as food bianco has pretty good pizza after chef did grow up brooklyn pizza thin crusted good amount cheese sauce woodoven cooked menu has choice 7 8 pizzas appetizers deserts

if want good pizza without wait go somewhere else if want wait 2 hours eat good pizza able say ate pretentious biancos then go try it

added finally think part reason think overhyped because pizza opinion something like biancos pizza has minimal ingredients uncomplicated tricks trade course probably lot skill goes into making dough exactly right way can respect does good job sauce probably has ingredients seasonings add quality end day pizzaand american pizza makes pizzas himself because wants not because has if wanted cant imagine would terribly difficult hire assistants help put sauce toppings cheese,2,1
had heard about growth chain wondered theyre doing different now can say done

first last visit quiessence 6aug 

1 power ac shut off several times approx 8 yet management did nothing compensate other than apology after 1st outage 

2 1215 per person price chefs spread appetizer far too high minimal amount food provided took over 20 minutes arrive yet nothing had cooked 

3 entrees took over 30 minutes arrive 

4 bill arrived added automatic 18 gratuity two people ive discovered standard operating procedure wrong defeats purpose gratuities server no incentive provide good service apparent long waits fact gratuity also charged bottle wine more later deplorable

5 look bill saw wrong bottle pricier one charged bill we had ask another staff member get waitress seemed forgotten did take change bottle should necessary prices charged quiessence

6 yes know quiessence working farm so should reduce prices reflect setting poor electrical service should include better lighting path restaurant parking area

i am severely disappointed dining experience quiessence had looking forward dining years overpriced appetizers poor service nonapologetic management slap face automatic 18 gratuity makes wonder quiessence could survive especially economy other similarlyprices restaurants would simply not allow these issues exist,1,1

i completely agree though review ch music front begin had really nice chilled out vibe little bit jason mraz similar styles playing just right audio level could music could also hold conversation then whoa hold minute over 50s disco clientele getting down 80s tunes singing along neil diamonds sweet caroline try get tune out head now thats we asked check left now im no youngster lets just say tick 3540 age box survey so im not looking scottsdale nightclub just looking relaxed cool funky space local think plenty places already offering something silver haired crew chandler hope living room doesnt become one 
so 3 stars would 4 stars music mixed message vibe just didnt work give one more shot sure really want place successful,3,1

came last saturday night family im not sure we were thinking we didnt try make reservation until 200pm left 2 options 515 915 neither were appealing really wanted try restaurant so we went 515 sitting certainly felt strange eating early quickly got over once started taste food

the first problem had restaurant everything looked so good family must spent good 10 minutes optimizing order we coordinated strategic attack menu making sure we got try least one thing form every part menu

we started bruschetta pesto flatbread bruschetta alright little small terms portions waiter did try tell pesto flatbread everyone table fought over much larger than bruschetta had creamiest most delicious goat cheese top 

we then had mixture salads entrees wasnt feeling hungry remember 515 so just got simple green salad let tell 5 pretty reasonable sized salad simple vinaigrette very flavorful

my family members were very happy dishes well sweet potato cannelloni big eyed tuna natural chicken real winner evening sangria

we ordered pitcher red sangria tempranillo cassis blackberry raspberry strawberry start even considered ordering more had lovely sweetness came fruits very addicting definitely ordering again

i can definitely see myself coming again trying other salads white sangria too,5,-1
yes can honestly say actually visited little dive bar off scottsdale road thomas same little dive bar ive probably passed thousand times over last five years saturday night we had 40 minutes before start final spring training ballgame season we were hungry knowing most restaurants were overtaken tourists those out night town we started driving came across dirty drummerand we went 

the dirty drummer exactly would expect looking outside however has odd charm character same time walked inside noticed walls were lined tvs nice flat screen ones probably perfect place watch game pool tables welcome guests game tables surround bar sits middle room 

the food itself decent bar food exactly would expect bar food homemade potato chips were tasty grilled wings extra sauce were good so were burgers bar dive clean plus 

its times like these wish could add half point review because while cant give dirty drummer four stars think solid three stars plus half one if yelp allowed plan coming back again very near future,3,1

mixed feeling about w scottsdale during day pool area poorly run evenings pool turns into pretty fun nightlife spot 

daytime
the pool always jam packed fairly disgusting crowd dudes out number babes 3 1 count id say thats no fun oh dudes mean douche bags babes more like gross skanks covered makeup pool ok guess im being hater spend hours might kind disgusted scene too just really amateur hour piss poor service bad attitudes obnoxious patrons only reason came because friend likes stay w visiting too noted quality place has declined over years has stayed four different w locations ny south beach westwood said one worst trashiest took hour before waitress came over ask if we wanted drinks food started get service always long wait pitcher margaritas buckets beer food speaking food fries fish tacos club sandwich great grilled cheese not so much first 42 pitcher margaritas weak hardly tasting alcohol second pitcher stronger fair saturday service much better

nighttime
much improved scene still not great lot outoftowners since hotel still plenty locals too think good mixture pants collared shirts required so usually gets rid most tank top neck tat wannabes earlier day pool really just trading one group wannabes another man im hater huh oh well can handle drinks overpriced w ready spend lots o cash

thanks yelp bff found place typing vegan im so glad did very good

while we were ordering drinks turbo dog purple haze cohort obviously louisianaborn chef came out asked if we had ever before im glad did because friend pretty hardcore vegan wanted know details stinkys vegan gumbo not automatically vegan veggie chicken isnt veggie sausage side potato salad isnt can substitute blackeyed peas so ordered stinky gumbo without chicken substituted blackeyed peas side normally costs 1 extra chef said we could do so waitress waived extra fee

whew bit work friend very happy get exactly expecting chef incredibly knowledgeable courteous about questions apparently vegan bunch years vegetarian bunch more now just has occasional meat check out quality restaurant perfect even mentioned trying find source vegan chicken so eventually would no substitutions necessary

in group we additionally ordered seafood gumbo chicken sausage gumbo chicken fricasee hush puppies im no expert authentic cajun cuisine do know like liked food lot everyone else group equally pleased dishes

my big bowl chicken sausage gumbo ive never had before full chicken andouille sausage okra spicy soup base rice okra wasnt even slightly slimy expecting after years hearing about much maligned vegetable blackeyed peas were equally spiced delicious husbands fricasee chicken potato stew rice had slower equally significant amount heat 

there poker tournament going so we were really only diners time im sure accounts level attention we received chef definitely appreciated came out after we had chance sample meals make sure we were happy we were also let know about other social events would bring location variety bands metal country well poker tournaments like

the beer awesome too two brews cohort ordered turbodog purple haze both made louisiana turbodog frighteningly darklooking without heavy dark beer taste think amberbock if actually good beer purple haze lighter beer slightly peculiar aftertaste only had sip so im not sure whole glass would taste like

damn yelp no half stars guess write review then decide between 3 4 after brain dump 

i gallaghers twice now first time saturday night karaoke second final playoff game go cards over span those two visits tried quite items 

the nachos really really good use nacho sauce versus shredded cheese happen think pretty tasty however salad ordered left quite bit desired kept getting crunchy gross part lettuce head so only half salad edible cookie sundae pretty damn good well also had cheese crisp no complaints about 

perhaps best thing about place 3 well drinks am used paying 59 damn vodka tonic so pleasantly surprised paid under 10 three drinks 

now service another story im sorry say both times has left something desired completely understand place packed football day whole place reserved advance so feel like should more prepared had ask limes three times waited twenty minutes get one also took almost forty minutes get damn nachos first showed up 

another flaw put baconchicken salad even though specifically said no meat had previously told waitress vegetarian ordered nachos 

oooooo now think about very worst part experience we were seated near patio so every time someone opened door cigarette smoke rushed eyes were watering coughing whole time pretty uncomfortable actually 

overall gallaghers pretty good sports bar relatively good food great priced drinks definitely service issues 

damn still cant choose between 3 4 know back im going 3 if im impressed next time update,3,1
so so actually prefer einstein brothers bagels,3,1
place great we were told locals come rather than waiting two hour line other favorite pizza spot area atmosphere really made dinner old house redone restaurant we sat outside were twinkly lights everywhere great jazz musician playing live music background

very cute place predominantly female clientele seemed quite happy not terribly impressed 

i had 10 chicken club small sandwich enormous plate teensy weensy fruit cup sandwich good enough although bit heavy fat really wasnt enough food looked very forlorn sitting plate tiny plastic ramekin grapes slices cantaloupe

southwest service sky harbor really really starting slip

on past 6 occasions ive had misfortune flying southwest phx average 45 minutes delayed worst last thursday delayed over two hours 

southwest hub phoenix one planes fritz just bring one several stash time money youre late am losing money instance last week am losing vacation time even more valuable dont get much it

the consistent inconsistency one thing married people now habitually encounter flights getting too damn much pain ass fly discount airline

last week pretty good example mind southwest cant control purchases seats flights flight attendants seem so overtly fond banning people dress political commentary really dont do jack shit air

there child mother behind flight little bastard wouldnt calm down wouldnt stop screaming about oh can see grandpas house 35000 air wouldnt stop kicking seat useless womb mother could do oh jeffy calm down give mommy kiss mind if had wearing one objectionable tshirts wouldnt let plane even after several passenger complaints lady flight attendant attendants absolutely refused do anything speak mother

three hours shit just too much sorry

southwest really has become greyhound sky last year so one more flight booked year so far if hand travel last time fly two bit trash festival stratosphere,2,-1

since we had never had russian food we decided adventurous we ordered home made fruit drink did not agree palates sumsa bread filled ground beef onions start we also ordered bread cant remember name eat marinated lamb marinated beef sheesh kabobs

fruit drink did not finish not not sweet had odd aftertaste
sumsa did not finish tasted smelled like meat filling had gone rancid before cooking
bread majority consumed tasteless edible
marinated beef did not finish tough chewy tasteless
marinated lamb did not finish chunks fat bone no meat seen absolutely disgusting

needless say not returning recommending place anyone wish could rate place zero stars yelp does not allow it

she also interrupted several times rude then went called corporate just double check came table said said no were not cook way seriously we did not ask do actually accused being undercover shoppers we started say something then again interupted

listen if explain choice not company wishes present product we still choose different way should comply after money decision raised rules 1 customer always right 2 if customer wrong refer rule number 1

dismayed heartbroken yelp reviewed establishment not cracked up im saddened comparison italian grotto old towns main drag place fails miserably tear

our server plain bad lied lacking know didnt take time find out am talking about well fridays lent so catholics day abstain red meat seafood veg can eaten so took orders ladies went house salad while chose soup day seafood gumbo had asked if meat seafood gumbo server rattled off without making sure no meat gumbo seafood so if youve eaten gumbo altho may seafood theres usually andouille sausage so believed salads soup came lo behold soup seafood yes yuckiness yes drum roll pls meatball last time checked thats meat not seafood so soup fail server failed ladies were telling start ruckus made decision myself would no next time place

we ordered frito misto appetizer mix calamari three shrimp notice discrepancy 3 small breaded shrimp plate calamari nonflavorful marinara two stars

seafood gumbo zero stars

i ordered pesce alla vodka shrimp calamari vodka cream sauce three shrimp three scallops wasnt jumbo shrimp thats ok alright nothing wow nothing would forget about soup incident silently forgive messup come back no meh so two stars

unlimited garlic bread ok three stars

and tiramisu dessert ok lets state favorite places tiramisu parlor grotto both ridiculously orgasmic one heavy powder top lady fingers were kinda dry if those two place orgasmic ummm one more like satisfying not good so two half stars

isnt south mountain people isnt damn nature hike isnt one those trails wander along flipflops talk about weather take pictures smell flowers shit exercise camelback fin mountain 

so moved way chandler east phoenix just closer camelback thats right love mountain ive hiking both trails 2 3 times week off last 5 6 years never gets old

there 2 very different trails start opposite sides mountain meet up top parking can pain so recommend riding bike if possible bike racks both trailheads

the cholla trail trailhead east side mountain e cholla ln heads west off n invergordon rd just north phoenician about halfway between mcdonald camelback park along n invergordon rd walk up e cholla ln 

the echo canyon trail trailhead northwest corner mountain n echo canyon circle heads south off e mcdonald theres actually parking lot trailhead complete portapotties water fountain pretty small fills up fast theres little more parking along n echo canyon circle then couple bigger parking lots further west down e mcdonald north side road pretty good walkjog these lots though

both trails rock prefer echo chollas nice steady slowly getting higher harder each turn echo other hand over place youre going up youre going down youre going around really keeps toes echos got those rail sections everybody loves chollas definitely got own steep sections too theyre right near top things considered think cholla easier two

things remember
1 water youre gonna need so bring plenty it
2 shoes sneakers work youre going wish had something little more rei
3 gloves im surprised dont see more people wearing em really come handy especially those steep sections youre climbing lot eat shit land palms
4 ettiquette yield people hikers going down yield hikers going up hikers kidsdogs yield everybody

in terms fried chicken lolos doesnt even make top 10 nothing against shop run really friendly people yardbird not flavorful once get past crunchy salty skin may well best thing phoenix thats not saying whole lot now mind im comparing likes prices chicken coop charlotte scotch house new orleans compared those esteemed joints lolos just bland

i realize sounds like im just being callous judgmental drunk can true honestly cant even put words uncomfortable people make am pretty sure theyre not going shank walk back car im not entirely sure know talk people let alone serve seem rather nervous doesnt make feel much ease during meal especially after ive waited unreasonable amount time refill box leftover vittles

im originally kansas city missouri home original barbecue though several barbecue restaurants town arent consistent mouth watering cooked smoking grill like stacys bbq period closest most bbq restaurants town come fresh maybe cole slaw precooked out bag flamed grill
then top bbq off cheap store brand preserved sauce


the sauce handmade scratch stacys meat smoke tender nothing about restaurants food isnt good 


ive read lot reviews seems one two people were dissatisfied were either complaining about waiting during visit hmm thats restaurant not mcdonalds fast food no doesnt need hostess sitting people down called restaurant


there another said not hospitality im not covering anyone place business obvious being best food ever 4 country found out about bbq place cares were arizona beautiful place live lot people rude new york more separate than mississippi 50s


ultimately think time post review if nothing nice say unless closest ever journalist 


bottomline food authentic meat smoked fresh sides appetizing those may complain about side not being cooked scratch right order comeon now not even ruths steak house cooking one serving green beans time

this one best restaurants town eat bbq,5,-1

3 hate high tables stools hate really really fucking hate sure normal seats tables backin dark bad kids go feel restricted clausterphobic no comfy seats seen hanging out bar weird cause really inviting yourself talk whomever next can coolor suck ass so just cant get fucking comfortable

4 side patio soooo lovely smokers leave beers inside one friend stated cant smokers smoke out front let drinkers get enjoy beautiful side patio peace

5 snacks no food so much rich kids mom well stocked cabinets

6 beer service basically guy barkitchen opening bottle fine love diverse beer selection after telling guy liked beer picked kronenberg drink tap cornish pasty get drink delicious food so totally spot beer menu would go long way describing each beer import alchohol percentage price etc one didnt see it

7 bathrooms wicked nice

so space really malleable perfect one one especially group settings hey like place enough go phoenix yeah probably lot near art walk roosevelt modified etc guarenteed unshady time had fun both times

i never go back poorly managed restaurant life just clear wasnt rude sweet little girl turned away because knew wasnt decision manager should out explaining problem little more diplomacy if going turn people away then figure out right way say so actually come back if owner manager would done every job place trying lend extra hand so didnt turn customers away would buss tables wash dishes if had maybe im bitch im bitch knows get shit done whoever managesowns pearl do not message dont send little baby workers turn away customers dont know do without pissing people off also telling people not going give service because want get service deserve crap thing say not fine dining establishment according reviews service isnt great guess im never getting service deserve because im never going back disaster,1,1

am definitely starting like dining farms makes feel like im supporting local economy also getting fresh food

we came before flight out phoenix yesterday lieu dining morning glory cafe once we left downtown phoenix s mountain wait had increased 30 minutes making wait one hour would make cut too close flight back san francisco

so we walked back way front farm decided grab lunch true selection sparse ingredients fresh someone mentioned didnt understand so expensive well think do small farmthey dont mass produce product so course things going more expensive top off sustainable farm so things come price

anyway back review decided try red grape walnut salad consisted grilled chicken mixed greens red grapes walnuts gorgonzola crumbles served raspberry vinaigrette also opted get passion fruit iced tea delicious without added sweetness

the salads already prepacked were fresh sandwiches made order friend got old fashioned turkey sandwich grill roasted pulled turkey organic fi eld greens house made cranberry relish chipotle mayo multigrain bread able try sandwich soooo good very delicious fresh salad also very good thoroughly enjoyed could taste difference freshness

chain alert
this place chain decent meal yes slightly over priced food isnt greatest atmosphere cross between rubios joes crab shack service compareable well

i ordered fried whitefish tacos see pics got little chips salsa salsa bar heres meal panned out

the tacos were great baja sauce not typical white sauce looked more like fry sauce if youre utah tasted great mixed tablespoon red hot sauce beans were unmashed pintos prefer over everything except whole black beans were decent nothing great mixed bit pico de gallo flavor up bit rice horrid hate say know those grains rice arent cooked hard ones break teeth outside yeah those were randomly encountered during consumption not pleasant experience portions were small didnt complain because tacos were actually pretty good were crispy could tell were battered fried order surprising

the salsa bar mediocre red hot sauce more vinigarry word than deliciously hot pico de gallo made canned tomatoes chips were so old time got were broken shards former selves pity looking good chip pig out

the service very good first waitress told seat myself come up order convenience did another waitress took order promptly wait wasnt long about 5 minutes ordering receiving food tables were quickly cleaned everyone seemed happy customers employees very comfortable pleasant setting

overall restaurant has meh effect didnt hate dont think id back

easily worst golf course ever played several problems it

first desert course not theres anything wrong desert courses holes fairway does not start until 150200 yards off tee thats fine most courses one if dont hit fairway itll nothing dirt rocks no rough anything most long holes if mess up tee shot hole blown

second layout dangerous especially back nine one spot three holes more less converge right path errant shots not one two three holes keep eyes open can get nailed

third no enforcement pace whatsoever we played during summer line tee most front nine game took 5 12 hours play ridiculous

finally very holes yardage markers combine no gps makes club selection very difficult if not impossible tough get accurate measurement eying using scorecard

the only redeeming part course island green sixth hole although should note appears if nobody bothers repair ball marks,1,-1

the small shop located downtown phoenix fairly easy find walk find pretty modern cleanlooking décor small space seating inside well patio outside so can sit back enjoy gourmet cookie long youd like woman behind counter quick help after finding out id never before sharing personal favorites

they offer about five different types cookies 250 each buy six get one free although didnt try beverages also offer tea course organic milk wash down those cookies also sell dog treats urban cookie brand eco bags cookie gift boxes after browsing web site also found out deliver cookies milk door after hours damn 

i tried three types cookies urban cookie dark chocolate rolled oats toasted walnuts coconut simple urban milk chocolate molasses brown sugar special holiday coco mint peppermint chocolate powdered sugar three were delicious coco mint cookie absolute favorite reminds girl scout thin mint cookie crack knocked away chocolate rich would little too dark if refreshing peppermint taste wasnt complement perfectly simple urban great version classic chocolate chip both milk chocolate molasses brown sugar made amazingly sweet least favorite three simple urban not because tasted bad quite opposite delicious too im not biggest coconut fan because gritty taste gave cookie

wasnt bad pizza even bad pizza pretty good

that being said wasnt great pizza wasnt super good 75 bill two pies two salads two glasses wine expect lot more

its nice sit down spot love location notes

 service isnt good
we ordered two salads two pies pies came out before salads did so pizzas sat got cold while we finished salads am big fan things being timed plated properly especially am paying we did dinner

also hand customers proper pizza box leftovers not styrofoam container classy move give cardboard box since youre trying classy place go solid

 too much salt
they use lot salt dough toppings so much so girlfriend having hard time later night sodium intake if food good dont need much salt make great take down 80

 work wine list
for over priced get something different stop stock bottles everywhere else phoenix

 damn loud
the acoustics unrelenting if plan having conversation date fellow diners try somewhere else


 
long story short youre not pizzeria bianco stop trying pretend go different direction get better,2,1
pei wei one favorites thats partially due wonderful food management particular restaurant exceeds others manager jimmy knows keep staff patrons happy weve weekends even valentines day line nearly out door because establishment runs such tight ship we never had wait longer than 10 minutes table busiest nights highly recommend honey seared chicken kung pao mongolian beef service earns 5 star rating,5,-1
really little kid family used get takeout time then 15 years ago became vegetarian other stuff happened reason we just stopped going had nothing do establishment suppose other than were closer options takeout we didnt go out often remember distinctly manapua absolute favorite thing well eating rice covered teriyaki sauce

now 15 years later eat chicken fish againand one first cravings upon visiting hometown come back try place again finally got go recently im hooked 

everything delicious really cant go wrong ordered combo number 4 think teriyaki chicken bulkogi combo comes salad rice orange wedge bulkogi pretty awesome breaded fried chicken thing comes unique tangy bbq sauce delicious teriyaki chicken fantastic epitome teriyaki chicken should distinct hawaiian flare sometimes lets call less than desirable cuts chicken hardly matters youre scarfing down like was

the rice brought back surprisingly so did salad salad has well dont know kind dressing delicious hadnt thought about before coming tasted instantly transported back childhood

the only bad thing id say about restaurant really almost better get togo absolutely no added benefit taste temperaturewise atmospherically otherwise dining fact togo containers seem keep teriyaki sauce out salad bit better than styrofoam plates get instore environment inside very backtobasics no frills no problem given option think id rather get food togo just eat home while watching movie something

anyway really very good food probably best hawaiian food phoenixat least far know definite keeper locale frequent im town,4,1

one most impressive things about greene house part conglomerate restaurants owned managed fox group rarely does one find quality restaurant does not follow formula part larger restaurant group

the idea behind greene house offer dishes inspired farms markets ranches california fresh ingredients can appreciated non chain restaurant dining crowd decor includes updated craftsman design complete cooper wood embellishments hand made light fixtures refreshing respite usual layout local chains outdoor patio dining well open dining room make fantastic destination during warm evenings area

while other reviewers commented high prices greene house similar meals restaurants san francisco bay area would easily cost double not only did comment we reviewed menu each 5 dining companions bay area also made same remark greene house relative bargain opinion greene house offers incredible value quality food prepared however lower cost areas such phoenix scottsdale can understand one would perhaps little taken back 1100 lunch entree though bargain bay area standards

our meals were very well prepared lightly battered fish chips parmesan truffled oil french fry appetizer others group ordered items yogurt dressing salad pasta twin kobe burgers again well prepared fair portions only comment would greene house should not name twin burgers kobe burgers since meat not kobe japan domestic american wagyu beef angus beef flavorful tender should named such not mislead diner while knew better would ever expect pay nominal 1200 true kobe beef burger those never experienced true kobe beef might misinformed true texture flavor delicacy

overall fine restaurant always dining list visiting scottsdalephoenix area,4,1

i wish someone would rate other classes open studio because stuff looks totally fun really do get dirty no matter perfect try so warn repeatedly wear play clothes

im 42 took mentee twelve year old girl shes very grownup just being clear we both looovved neither had ever used pottery wheel could barely restrain ourselves mishy instructor resident artist desert dragon kept saying wait get really amazing addicting get hands clay watching wheel spin cool shapes come out

as beginners we were warned prepare love whatever we made quickly possible move next one because over loving clay piece can lead totally messing up making too thin lopsided crazy beginners we each made three pieces were totally different im not completely sure happened apparently youve doing forever maybe even 6 classes so learn control more purposefully create look want

the first thing we said ourselves we sat wheel want one closely followed can we come back answer open studio time can pay clay firings mishy warned we can come play alone if we do right away we might really frustrated because we really needed more time learn basics centering instructor around suggested another class five lol since group want come said if least four book together could set class just would 25 each instead full price plus we get own class totally cool

if still seems pricey do dirty hands friday just 12 get play clay no wheel learndo basic clay techniques totally want go

we were told come back 3 weeks glaze gorgeous creations we cant wait

btw since husband asked question yes waaaay more fun than going those painting clay places were both mentors young kids so weve gone more than normal way more fun beccause youre creating clay piece btw still get paint those clay pieces too if youre into that

wanted sushi willing drive friends pv yasu sushi bistro highly recommended were too tired wanted something within block two hyatt 

they asked concierge recommended place very good 

has ever had good mexican food getting kickbacks

the matador restaurant across hyatt hotel center downtown has business since 1976 large imo bleh

it owned greek family one 32 years mexican dishes specialites were mostly one first cooks great make cook create recipes authentic dishes make money even small greek section menu offers low end greek dishes gyros sandwich gyros plate greek salad feta cheese plate something called shrimp ala mike

the menu has print so small only search light magnifying glass can decipher 

they do authentic dishes like menudo carnitas lengua con chile verde basics like enchiladas tacos tamales tostadas chimichangas carne asada chalupas fajitas flautas 

they bring chips two types salsa we ordered extra guacamole didnt taste look very fresh like mixed jar paste couple avacadoes margaritas were uninspired weak 

i tried machacas sauteed shredded beef moist lacked flavor supposed green chilis tomatos onions rice beans 1095 3 others group were unimpressed food were french canadien so do know about mexican food except isnt good

they also steaks chicken dishes bother 

the food passable would not entice come again unless got drunk ball game local chase field stadium were starving,2,1

wont even venture guess so people like place notes no nothing like european cafe no not actual wine bar yes service absolutely sucks

we came friends birthday party mother had arranged ahead time 10 wine brought tables poured appetizers brought out while we were waiting guest honor before lets start parking 

you cant park residential streets because need permit fine heard had valet theres nothing website about parking so whatever head valet asks if am dining postinos la grande orange say postinos says ok thats 3 asked if seriously were charging valet parking based restaurant going wouldnt answer asked if atm since had no cash told one doesnt work got back car drove around looking place park about 15 minutes fantastic

when get about 6 girls party standing front waiting someone notice finally very unfriendly gentleman pointed two tables said those yours those other tables people eating also yours theyre not done yet we told were seated needed done hour theyre still ok so now we only two four tables great finally seat two tables another unfriendly staff member comes over plunks down wine glasses asks if we want glass temperanillo pours one girls random taste then walks away upon return asked if wine we were supposed because malbec argued about minutes until pointed label said oh walked away never did find out if we were supposed malbec

at point other two tables had cleared no one brought other glasses put tables together so we did also no one opened other bottles yes were screwtop still so opened finally everyone else arrived we still only had 4 wine glasses after trying vain several minutes we finally managed flag down unfriendly woman asked more wine glasses responded rudely we dont more walked away had ask three different rude uninterested staff members wine glasses managed finally get another still not everyone ended up glass 

seriously anyway bruschetta came out while menu offers lof different ones so deplorably bland underseasoned felt unfinished fig marscapone prosciutto should good poor pig gave life disgraced dry flavorless most bread pieces werent even cut way through so we were manhandling pieces get apart bread obviously just grocery store bread doubt anything truly handmade issue quality ingredients sucks obviously buy cheapest grocery store crap can then mark up everything even apples one bruschettas were lacking real flavor should tart crisp instead dull mealy 

and wine bar seriously joke half sheet paper one side wine list no flights no tastings audience attracts easily impressed overpriced glop wine trendy area theyll continue do just fine never back,1,1

im town business buddy lives area suggested place dinner tonight boy am glad did 

let start ambiance very nicely decorated furnished southwestern style common down done nicely not gaudy tacky way nice outside patio seating area however considering im seattle temp still pushing 100 degrees we opted sit inside

once we were seated we were tempted order limit2 margaritas apparently famous decided against after taking drink order waitress brought basket chips bowl salsa

let stop right here

i knew just looking these were no ordinary chips not only were mixture different types chips regular tortillas sweet potato wontons each type topped different seasoning favorite being wonton chips topped seasoning powdered sugar giving sweet spicy flavor same time amazing asked waitress seasoning swear were laced cocaine well hands down best chips salsa ive ever had life would go back just that

once we overcame confusion super salad turns out asking if wanted soup salad ordered pueblo house salad start very nice sized salad could easily shared two people if someone wanted delicious honey chipotle vinaigrette dressing

for main course opted santa fe stuffed chicken breast came off sammex section menu according menu sammex created executive chef influence mexican spanish native american american southwest cultures chicken breast stuffed herbgoat cheese served over roasted red pepper cream sauce pine nut cilantro pesto grilled asparagus southwest rice

words cannot describe amazing fusion these different flavors combined into one superbly mind blowing dish

ill honest hard concentrate conversation buddy distracted each time took bite dont let know said that
 
at end meal we opted not order dessert crazy margarita we were treated waitress referred white chocolate tamales compliments chef course know read other reviews seems everyone gets these little treats whether chef really intended specifically not mute point after tasting great finishing touch amazing meal 

while dont often get down part country always fond memories little cafe called sams,5,1

the place cute triangular building lots windows no huge sign advertise maybe just being yelp help we walked small main dining area lots white ikea tables chairs cute flowers bright drapery covering sunny side buildings windows lots natural light very inviting staff greeted right away asked order up counter do not menus printed yet so assume coming 

we walked through doorway into more kitchen area had counter setup large board menu items daily lunch specials about 67 breakfast items lunch menu heafty list specialty drinks place really true asian fusion incompasing asia dabble extra places we just call world fusion lots really creative dishes things would not necessarily put together work 

i ordered calcutta egg wrap really unique tortilla egg were like one inside were veggies too onions omit next time including carrots cilantro tomato give side sweet chili sauce top other than onions fished most out delicious am not sure did egg do not know just eat sg ordered scrambled egg plate stir fried asian veggies loved combination surprised find great together

2 prices happy hour menu website incorrect paid 650 instead listed 550 chicken

the only item tried 45starworthy japanese fried chicken lightly breaded yummily juicy white meat very tasty small portion 709 though only about 7 8 small bitesized pieces

the taste made wish even more had not out oysters

but others noted price value equation pricey side

ps has pointed out helpful yelper oysters not season august thats were not serving thats fine would say restaurant owner if something menu available only certain months then should say menu oysters available only etc etc etc way people wont drive over get something out season,3,-1

mehhh has never described restaurant quite well does carlys 

they cant seem able land particular theme menu im not real sure would categorize supposed wine bar mexican mediterranean bistro cafe maybe can decide find menu items like tomato bisque quesadilla cheese platters olive plates hummus salads gyros barbeque sandwich meatball sub smoked salmon figs presciutto buffalo chicken flat bread pizzas

i enjoy ambiance downtown charm can find most every food spot roosevelt row nice service friendly smile average wait time between ordering arrival food large selection beer wine although didnt partake these lunch time after 

i went southwest chicken looking something added kick day asked spice up jalapenos only had green chili so went sandwich itself aok nothing really write home about mom if youre reading really wasnt intending writing home so stop reading 

when bill arrived completely surprised find charged added 1 meager addition green chili already 10 sandwich making total out door tax tip close 14 cannot good faith suggest anyone come preference over another let reserve judgement yourself should decide patronize opinion sandwich way over priced 14 maybe wouldnt so critical if lunch under 10

dont really like flying can generally handle reason though recent flight orange county had full panic attack airplane convinced we were going crash no idea whyit short smooth flight nothing unusual happened 50 so minutes we were air terrified landed made phx 35 hour layover first thing did look bar no way going make through much longer flight new orleans if first flight kind indicator

i found jose roux walking next gate plopped down bar relatively busy 3pm tuesday only one bartender behind bar greeted quickly smile ordered drink asked if wanted make double just couple bucks more well fine since twisted arm might well

two hours later 2 so 4 drinks calmer left bar go find next flight left feeling very pleased new found calmness experience jose roux drinks were very reasonably priced especially given fact airport no one seemed mind didnt order food point original bartenders shift ended replacement wasnt great little slow probably worked out favor anyway,5,-1

finally southeast asian food pulse around cenpho first moved one things noticed choices were comes asian cuisine so nice see something little less common like cambodian food get represented 

the spring rolls must 2 get very heavily stuffed roll rice paper touting chicken shrimp cilantro carrots etc beef salad also winner seafood soup flavorful just might literally nourish soul sandwiches pork pate great lunch choice one day got one plus roll goall under 6 desserts everyone should try sweet salty corn least once tapioca favorite light warm 

the best part about eating knowing money going toward very genuine kind cambodian family spoken chefowners son every time go real sweet guy demonstrate play xylophoneesque instrument centerpiece main dining room speaking love touches decor ie travel books cambodia every table

am happy update review based very positive response owner dustin regarding visit seemed truly concerned we had experienced poor service insisted making right food good overall despite one issue

my experience we came late dinner felt if staff put out we were one dish came out wrong kitchen tried say right dish server didnt do anything compensate issue toward end evening server not around busboy loudly stacked dishes behind then kept asking clear dishes before we were done 

while nothing experience would entice back flos previous good dining experiences dustins apology commitment making things right definitely makes experience night seem different wife flo want restaurant run,4,-1

used tiny little fast food vietnamese joint 6th street mill banged out pho cheap cheap cheap used frequent time unfortunately ingredients reflected price never so much purchased sign ended up going out business less than year 

i can only cross fingers hope same doesnt go dragonfly vietnamese kitchen original wicked fantastic located mesa has around couple years consistently produces great pho tripe tendon anyone papaya salad noodle dishes ever had new location theyve created sleek urban eatery fits right rest locations mill avenue manages trump every respect price service ambiance course food

dragonfly just opened week ago has large banner instead sign advertising presence judging lunch time crowd word mouth has really worked place lunch time specials impressive offerings papaya salad spring bowls rice plates several types pho vietnamese sandwiches soup ginger vinaigrette dressed greens side humblewait it750 im still baffled can offer such plentiful healthy delicious food such reasonable price

the soup day dungeness crab asparagus soup no way passing up crab soup measly salad such good decision go double soup pho soup du jour because peppered broth huge chunks real crab asparagus mushrooms baby corn out world we ordered spring rolls well were also huge poached pork shrimp vermicelli noodles mint lettuce bean sprouts cucumbers wrapped rice paper served best spicy peanut sauce ever had soup spring rolls would made perfectly adequate lunch once pho arrived dropped everything brothy delight

it served huge picking up trend square bowl thin slivered beef vermicelli scallions garnished bean sprouts lime wedges fresh mint jalapenos sriracha chili sauce hoisin sauce soy sauce combination these additional ingredients result savory concoction can help nurse cold open sinuses while warming core fresh healthy light scrumptious can see myself eating very very often future straying usual order pho branch out try other things menu still reasonably priced mill avenue joint fucking suck boa 8 12 bucks entree would also highly recommend fresh squeezed limeade made sparkling seltzer water instead still refreshing spritz flavor also full bar must mill avenue joint

the outdoor patio surrounded pretty twisted wrought iron canopy exit front store offer lovely dining experience since weather has started cool down inside restaurant color scheme green white plum black ambiance create fresh vibrant urban feel large bamboo fixtures nested beds smooth black rocks after talking server we were also informed hope mellow live musical act middle restaurant near future diners enjoy 

the service also amazing prompt friendly easy eyes attentive food ready lightening fast almost too quickly considering first courses can see speed great getting people lunch break out waiter charming making sure we got everything we could possibly need lightening speed 

i really really really hope place does well because want become regular so go check out support local business rather than shitty chain mill avenue can only hope more these gems continue pepper ever increasing stretch vapid consumerism so dont end up feeling like corporate whore after meal dont want taint dining experience good whoredom

i could see chilis out window told everyone id rather spend same amount money burger fries least someone would refill drink bring food id booth people cant bump chair while picking up food because theyre too lazy walk around table side theres enough space get through
the decor consists sacks potatoes plain tables white walls covered raving reviews should think about decorating something other than reviews so doesnt let down customers high expectations,3,-1

if business judged repeat customers retains then andersons 5th very successful

with same clique people coming back every weekend made easy make friends sometimes tougher meet new people find new faces

ive never concerts comedy shows judging music memorabilia walls can tell place has history music 

andersons only night club ive ever had transexuals picketing parking lot ive also had more married women approach than other club ive attended

saturdays just seemed like 30somethings night out larger room played 80s music like had heard 10000 times over course life mean do really need go club hear ahhh were half way thereliving prayer
of course not allowed 30somethings cut loose after not being out town months

the dark room offered more regulars more people enjoyed dancing bauhaus sisters mercy knowing isnt another local club could do plus could dress outlandish wish not people looking outcasts try putting plastic red flowerpot head like devo members did going devils martini 

andersons a5 regulars might call very consistent parking very accessible met people became good friends

unfortunately trannies won out andersons probably didnt judge success same people made home every saturday night rather much money could make save if club turned into something far different 

i subtracted star poor decision do that

so thai esan lets get down business 

premise

i hungry wanted dinner not break bank dinner so either gallo blanco thai food guess won

scene

sitting discreetly indian school facing former shoeboxedsize aura chez nous now fluorescentlit cube fresh n easy 

you walk then find way around wooden partitions encounter room surprisingly very ornate painted walls heavy ornate tables chairs still shrinkwrapped plastic covering lol traditional thai folk music softly playing overhead

i only customer point expecting friend join told traditionallydressed hostess therell party two room however did not table even remotely small sat round table 6 fine just little amusing wondered lunch scene like bunch single diners eating these giant tables

food service

my friend joined minutes later took while get hostess attention given we were seated out sight kitchen behind wooden partition we eventually ordered following

 green papaya salad
 drunken noodles chicken
 massaman curry beef

all were ordered thai spicy now never phoenix thai restaurant actually made anything extra spicy done well whenever ive requested so skeptical thought worth trying anyway

and so

 green papaya salad sure hell made thai spicy good loving heat very fresh tasting least evening friend dying little slowly melting beside trooper kept eating good work amigo rating 45

 drunken noodles chicken if actually gave dish id more accurately rate however placed front chicken stir fried basil no noodles anywhere neither were patient enough take back make correct dish so we ate anyway wasnt spicy wasnt bad either per se not very memorable 35

 massaman curry beef im big fan southern thai dish done well flavors usually pretty distinguishable other coconut milkbased curries thai restaurant menu should point one wasnt really kind generic not very spicy either just like previous dish not bad not memorable either 35

 service decent non existent times weird given we were only diners room entire time also getting orders wrong theres no one elses orders mix up not so great

final verdict

so ok kind place started out promising drifted little downwards ornately done room very reasonable prices plus 

would eat again think so maybe had off evening nothing had bad

would recommend others if theyre really curious about maybe terms thai restaurants phoenix area definitely better ones around then again worse ones too 

thai esan sits comfortably middle pack 

3 stars,3,1
even menus regular common ordinary menus flavors each foods tried tonight great ate mushrooms chicken green beans seaweeds fried rice kimchi just ok 

the price about 20ish same price can get lot more options other place buffet such more dim sum options big lobster sweet pork belly etc,4,1
im fan mainly because drinks thoroughly enjoyed old fashioned drink bartender even put tiny bottle bitters upside down drink slow released sipping hanging out friends birthday celebration friends ordered more unique coctails extraodinary ingredients would difficult replicate these drinks since would difficult find exact ingredients entertaining drinks prepared front makes different pouring just drink mixtures together unique ingredients one drinks being made looked like fire being poured back forth between two coctail shakers maybe since drinks so expensive plan eating less downstairs make up it
i get people find whole going back side restaurant up stairs guided bouncer little corny so bouncer host whever call cant remember name very friendly nice informative made suggestions about good drinks try down earth helpful helpful hint usually dont like parties bigger than 6 upstairs 24 preferable
i guess should known ambiance citizen public house restaurant speak easy would just trendy looking pictured actual old school speak easy stuck head beforehand so surprised see little conversation set couches fireplace even though not totally impressed living roomlooking speak easy still fun different way getting drinks so do recommend least trying drinks once because serve different drinks upstairs ones down restaurant havent found places like either arizona yet yet key word,4,1

swear god would give place seven stars if were possible maybe 8 staple friends out town preface oh think good mexican food blank youve lied welcome el molino

el molino purists usually native phoenicians mexican food addicts like myself go lengths remind scottsdale location now not flagship el molino actually one oldest mexican food spots town originally 22nd st washington just east downtown 

the new location unassumingly hidden behind pizza hut express corner scottsdale osborn dont fooled place no fly night

everything good especially recommend anything has chile beef green little spicier than red neither overbearing paricularly goto get nana rosa special make tortillas house can taste freshness authenticity best one wont disappointed,5,1
literally anyone taste buds digestive system can make work ghengis one restaurant could walk away grill holding bowl of
1 curried fried rice shrimp egg sprouts
2 honey soy brown rice spinach tofu broccoli carrots
3 white rice teriyaki beef sesame scallions
4 udon noodles peanut sauce pork onions snap peas
5 rotini noodles roasted tomato sauce sausage
6 tortillas filled bbq chicken onions peppers
7 disgusting combination anyall above plus calamari congealed sauce accidentally poured onto food instead into sauce cup

the endless possibility offers novel appeal exciting promise own creation also makes exceptionally difficult know pair nicely together unless youre experienced ghengisgoer can already cook if can already cook deuce doing ghengis grill plus if do succumb being overwhelmed choices food sucks fault then theres always chance food sucking not fault two separate occasions chef has broken egg before cooking just served dish sans egg fried rice without egg nothing

basically if youre looking somewhere eat rather diverse group uncultured people lot children everyone can find something eat 10 dollar flat rate however if youve got even inkling gastronome dont expect impressed,3,1

pros very nice quality large screen neat seats move movie

cons well lets see

we went see hunger games we had groupon 2 tickets large popcorn sounds awesome know well we upgraded dbox seats move movie extra 8 dollars ticket seats were neat definitely not worth not very comfy 

i wanted use coupon had gotten signing up email list told go box office print out assumed manager told couldnt accept because fine print invisible said had printed whatever 

concessions waaaaaaay overpriced mean way more than already obligatory astronomical movie markup opinion shouldnt charge much small amount nonrefillable stale popcorn really really stale btw

customer service sucked no one older than 17 isnt bad thing except inexperienced management leads horrible service heard times ok whatever well theres nothing can do fact place pretty empty reason every time needed someone no one two concession stands no one really 

oh forgot mention movie start 730 wouldnt let anyone until 720 because were cleaning sure didnt look clean popcorn seats

sucked im not usually so harsh agree bev lack organization hard believe

before even make door tickets were 10 each 5 parking charge luckily we bought ours groupon parked nearby vacant lot so we were only out 10 total

food lines were 1 hour vendors did not even offer 2 samples advertised plus after waiting hour line wants buy sample move onto another line

the vendors were not allowed sell drinks were sold couple central points park equaled more lines sever over charging come 4 bottle water doesnt even cost much airport

they need more trucks limit number tickets time tickets something

it took about
 1 hour 15 minutes get pizza
 almost 2 hours get frybread
 almost 30 minutes get cupcakes

no offense food trucks food tasty did not seem were prepared kind volume low rating strictly organization event not food trucks themselves,1,1

ive had pretty mediocre food times down street house so think just keep hoping get better carne asada totally bland quesadillas practically inedible one good thing salsa bean dip

just before checkout almost every time grab one favorite dessertssweet cold coconut rice beans comes small cup unlike other places make desserts inhouse because like dessert cold multitask road hoping not cause kind accident way back work

i am just grateful places like da vang still exist loyal customer since 1889 kid kid course im not old

but happy hour though 116pm seriously stops happy hour 6pm pretty decent worth checking out area location greatest blessing curse if work oc great bar almostwalking distance since work oc youre likely bump into coworkers managers office often sipping cocktails ladies other than wives

oh dear look away pretend never saw each other

social awkwardness aside pretty pleased accommodations living room organized 20 people happy hour were able reserve community table extend happy hour until 7pm not hard bargain server suuuuuper slow although understandable crazy packed venue still quite annoying 

their cocktails tad pricey decently put together tasty out food probably best thing damn menu caprese dish fresh mozzarella served pesto cherry tomatoes aged balsamic reduction toasted bread super simple incredibly delicious bruschettas were tasty nothing yell about roasted red pepper hummus standard hummus bread weve tried olive tapenade bit better nothing cant make home pinwheel rolls were aok cider vinaigrette beyond terrible did not go well tortilla bread sandwich contents yuk finally fondue simple nice 10 think ratio dipping items cheese little off read we need more cheese more cheese

ruths chris steak house located scottsdale indian bend roads

the dining area somewhat darkly lit

to begin like shrimp whether barbecued shrimp shrimp cocktail entrée recommend filet tbone latter if big appetite

appetizer prices range about 13 16 steaks range about 35 45 however porterhouse feed two people porterhouse two upwards about 80

my main problem ruths chris steak house seem butter steak excessively moreover prices bit inflated get expected

perhaps discontent massproduced feel get chain restaurant not just ruths chris,3,1

earnhardts chrysler jeep robbed innocence 

i went earnhardts test drive wrangler thus begins first encounter demon seed known earnhardts sales staff

i looking around lot checking out different versions years wrangler somewhat smarmy otherwise friendly salesman asked if interested jeep told not interested buying anything just test drive 

he said cool asked one so could drive picked white sahara grabbed keys front desk got copy id off we went nice shot price over 30k thing balked said not chance 

so we went back lot suggested take back lot look over wranglers had find one within price range point didnt know jack squat about much one should cost because didnt expect buy anything played along we finally found one told price range didnt tell much wanted spend so did figure out own so had test drive one instead 

it nowhere near nice sahara sticker said 23k so wasnt much shock system 30k even still wasnt really interested price undaunted quest commission asked if had trade said uh yeah eyes lit up like kid chrismas morning 

well we could easily get payments low want trade lets go run numbers repliedum no im cool ill just take car home 

then whipped out phrase ensnares hapless first time car buyers across country into web highpressure sales could we do get into car today

i said payment below 200

now anyone wasnt naive myself time would know no matter salesman says point theres no way can finance 23000 200 month without rolling into 15 year mortgage regardless assures possible 

to make long story short too late know after 8 hours torture chamber filled sales managers closers finance guys drove off bone stock wrangler se payment 383 really bad headache told had gotten great deal so must telling truth right

much like bad onenight stand everything looks much different next day lights too bad took year really scrutinze deal gave 

they sold jeep listed 17995 17995 5000 labeled additional dealer markup tiny little print bottom however since never looked sticker myself until long after sale didnt see 

my dealings service department equally lackluster warded friends family enemies religious leaders professors random strangers pets stay away earnhardts 

the only good thing can say about earnhardts huge stock if must visit find model want inventory take test drive then go another dealer get car no bull yeah except 5000 worth bull sticker price,1,1

when we first arrived we were really excited giant flying saucer roof once stepping inside excitement turned into mass disappointment looked like kitsch factor notwell not really kitsch more large faceless corporation would hope would think kitsch isim looking best western 
our host quick friendly we were seated promptly were only 3 parties beside massive restaurant yet waitress explained food would delayed because were tables ahead usummm 3 full tables out 100 like rush you
food came pretty gnarly looking being starved travelers we dove right first bite lead believe we made horrendous mistake shouldve waited next town braved generic bk drive thru rather than sit through meal rice ordered 2 out 3 we both agreed like old rice new rice hadnt cooked way thrown into food processor served ive never eaten rice both hard mushy looked like corn meal beans were most definitely can massively over salted ordered cheese enchiladas never did find tortilla supposedly wrapped entire entree cheese canned tomato sauce dining traveling companions also were disappointed angus beef burger patty not anything better than dried up patty mcdonalds wouldnt even serve b chicken enchiladas were dry crumbly 
my brother pulled out phone looked up yelp reviews place immediately exclaimed we stop eating leave we were much relieved do since food so terrible overwhelming amount reviews were negative even included instances food poisoningwhich we were feeling starting effects even before we got back car

word street locals new spot talk town so felt very lucky got go work dinner last night we breezed right reservation no problems waiters made feel comfortable right away liked feel place right away too high beamed ceilings big open glass doors cute stylish touches scattered about 

the cocktail menu looked die beer frame mind so went peach beer loved because reminded pyramid apricot ale one east bay faves others got amazing looking concoctions though so if ever get back ill sure get cocktail really impressed because one dining companions couldnt decide beer wanted so asked if could serve flight were happy oblige im not sure ended up getting charged effort still nice 

we got bunch appetizers share mac cheese not heavy gooey lot fancy mac cheeses ive had could not stop eating we also had enchiladas shrimp sweet corn amazing course couldnt resist brussels sprouts can never resist brussels sprouts liked had shaved manchego say ive had better cooked more flavorful brussels sprouts life think least favorite app roasted veggie because bit flavorless compared everything else people didnt seem too enthused about matzo ball soup either 

for entree shared half salmon dish half short rib neighbor theyve recently redone salmon dish so different way described menu waiter had really quiet voice so had repeat couple times basically now grill salmon salt pepper serve brussels petals cornbread panzanella cucmbers sort yummy vinaigrette loved love salmon super rare so wish had asked wanted everyone else perfectly fine short rib very good well we replaced mashed potatoes more roasted veggies also comes string beans one other favorite veggies 

the desserts were vast impressive despite loud showy protests couldnt help digging spoon into gourmet smores dish caramelized marshmallow chocolate covered bacon creme brulee standard good favorite sweet potato pie least favorite blueberry crumble surprised because positive would favorite 

im no expert scottsdale culture feeling little hotspot strip mall may major player local cuisine fresh classic dishes friendly service definite crowd pleasers,5,1
husband went groupon little tricky find other reviewers said not too bad we ate during happy hour so appetizers alcohol were cheaper definitely enjoyed mojitos had mango husband had original definitely recommend then came empanadas since other people said were good we both really enjoyed those husband got asado cornbread casserole chipotle mashed potatoes asado potatoes were pretty good we would get those again cornbread casserole awesome ordered tilapia cornbread casserole creamed corn creamed corn pretty yummy too kick tilapia ok not sure made unexciting considering love tilapia whatever wouldnt order again 
overall think we would go back happy hour just drinks appetizers dinner menu little pricey get maybe we would dinner again if prices were about 57 less realize seems like trivial amount entire bill 66 kind feel robbed would preferred spend much nicer place,3,-1

dont live side town met up visiting relatives way out town bon voyage lunch

when we walked one other couple restaurant not such great sign seeing we arrived peak lunchtime anyway we sat table looked over handful lunch specials 

three ordered lunch menu pad thai sweet sour chicken garlic chicken one ordered menu fried salmon

unlike other thai even chinese restaurants lunch specials did not come soup egg roll actually small spring roll 

the pad thai wasnt cooked red oil common western renditions dish actually just looked like lo mein different noodles didnt taste so cant comment told pretty good didnt contain much meat

my order sweet sour chicken somewhat deceiving menu said going served tomatoes so expected like chunks tomato actuality sauce tomato paste based chicken shaved so super thin had weird texture 

the order garlic chicken exactly same dish sweet sour chicken two exceptions sauce duh main garnish ginger dish smells incredible if youre not big fan ginger id avoid seriously should call ginger chicken garlic sauce

the fried salmon gave best presentation served cucumber tomato dishes pad thai served steamed rice salmon chunks were thinly coated tempura then lightly deep fried looked so yummy 

looks however can deceiving

the salmon meat relatively tough yet crumbly tasted mainly like inside fridge tupperware

all food tasted particularly garlic chicken extremely salty credit do give large portions exception pad thai we took food home

just heads up beverages theyre pricier than most other places caliber example if want coffee youre gonna shell out 350 apparently think very highly coffee perhaps use starbucks brand therefore think can charge starbucks prices shrug

this place wasnt terrible waiterowner attentive wont going back just didnt enjoy food much

i would rate twostar experience im giving three because walk can tell owners trying so hard either just dont know theyre doing far price vs competition concerned think food much more delicious than do,3,-1

its not scene know decided check out since offered discounted drinks food can turn down even old town

still suffering hang over night before order gin tonic sign feel like shit drinks were nicely pored cant say thats norm because sorta had connection little hungry split chicken quesadilla friend mediocre boring no flare just straight up bland looking immediately thought not throw little diced cilantro red bell pepper top color

the crowd expect old town music just rap hip hop mean place can cool think should shoot lounge feeling cool jazz mellow music let clubs do club thing think starter place most scottsdillians prior hitting old town very small quaint so one douchebag can ruin entire place

 can see potential place respect however truly not thing,3,1

 we walked inside immediately noticed contemporary decor definitely added initial appeal once we were seated didnt take long took look menu definitely dilemma because everything sounded so good not mention names dishes were attractive before actually ordering food since still had decide we got drinks were not shy liquor got get tangd has bacardi o fresh squeezed oj sprite tang rim boyfriend chose nice glass red extensive wine list

when came time get food we started off crabmeat artichoke dip mix rich cheesy fondue crabmeat artichoke hearts served spiced pita chips only downfall ran out pita chips had substitue tortilla chips until were done baking wasnt too bummed since chips worked just well waitress soon brought out fresh pita bread enjoy 

for main coarse we went delicious pad thai traditional spicy thai street food rice noodles shrimp tofu bean sprouts peanuts tamarind egg lime one favorite dishes world truly amazed well flavors worked together made dish even better we were able share still full

overall service great we didnt feel if we were being rushed bothered while eating again gorgeous day go such trendy decently priced restaurant would definitely go back rain shine

the boyfriend decided use groupon lunch saturday we couldnt made better choice centurion has laid back atmosphere perfect sitting outside having leisurely lunch we got only one other table sat so luckily we were able grab spot shade nice big canopy over patio help cut down direct sun inside looked cute tiny cute outside place be

we started off baked brie comes wrapped pastry shell jam inside grapes side warm gooey brie jam could go wrong ordered shrimp crab sandwich boyfriend went tenderloin sandwich both came salad side

my sandwich really good bread fresh loaded shrimp crab ordered without dijon did feel like could used something else overall liked boyfriend felt same way about sandwich good needed little something make great

the side salad very good spinach blackberries blackberry dressing simple good then again im big fan spinach too

i could see place becoming quite hot spot like said big potential think if fine tuned things could really really good recommend checking out now before wait hours get table,4,1
luckily dont job dress up suit every day so dry cleaning bills much less than used however do wear things need dry cleaned every now then ive used tatum ranch cleaners those needs over past years location convenient if live anywhere near tatum dynamite

car filthy mess no way clean freak 499 drive through wash would do trick needed works melted sticky horchata running down window side car no fun task remove nor vacuuming up mess backseat

but 25 los olivos had car shining like new smelling like potpurri windows were sparkling clean carpetsfloors were spotless dash so shiny could barely see driving home took about 25 minutes this

i guess could done myself saved 25 dollars didnt mind dropping extra cash pamper lady,4,1
gist classy food atmosphere reasonable price service decent only downside food salty side

as outoftowners during thanksgiving we werent really sure expect zinc bistro review looked great we were staying across street so we decided give shot am really glad we did got good vibe classy not stuck up dim lighting so kind romantic spacious so dont feel like youre right next fellow diners 

the dungeness crab crepe amazing two little crepes lobster sauce perfect appetizer size so dont feel stuffed after first course definitely leaves wanting more 

the purpose review really mention filet mignon sous vide most tender flavorful mignon we every had granted dont get filet very often 30 something couldnt pass up waitress kindly explained sous vide cooking method meat slow cooked vacuum sealed bag keeping juices soaked meat delicious must try it

we also had french onion soup well pork tenderloin must say downfall place food overly salty side so just prepare drink lot,4,-1

first johnny chu should ashamed call himself chef barely line cook stated previous reviews doesnt even taste own food accounts wide margin variety single dish may two different visits

so made reservations thinking may able sit bar because arrived 10 minutes early wrong ordered wait outside nearly 45 minutes later drink bar next door inquired about table girl didnt even look up acknowledge had said anything after minute so staring while continued ignore finally said table ready hmm

the food horrible fear those enjoy rather enjoy atmosphere come seen food either completely bland eg curry tasted water slight hint something couldnt even recognize so hot mask possible flavor calling themselves authentic asian cuisine just silly so holeinthewall asian restaurants could cook chu under table blindfolded

took family meet up old college pals hadnt seen years recent weekend visit started out strongly we got parking space right front score timing also good friends were just ahead line we ordered quickly were able find table pizza area accommodate six 

 would great time start reminiscing catching up right right uh except no microphoneannouncing system tell food ready words cashier asked if we would hear names if we werent next food counter not likely so unfortunately half waited food while other half waited back table im certainly not asking table service maybe pa system so those eating next door outside might able relax table before food arrives

eventually food came out seemed like took awhile im guessing thats partly because hovering around counter wasokay nothing special about sandwich turkeycheeseavocadoetc did not do very good job staying together sliding over place

once went perhaps unsurprisingly now defunct trader vics washington happy hour impressed neither food nor drinks not story

an almost empty restaurant making reservation comic relief excluding bustling bar area slightly after end happy hour holiday despite welldecorated hall brimming tiki kitsch should given indication since family dinner picky family already compromise location bit late change courses among goods we bartered were

 cosmo tidbits 22 enough fried meaty flavors three nothing note
 lamb curry 27 flavorless cream lamb soup would made campbells proud special no idea chef thinking this
 polynesian snowball 7 coconutencrusted vanilla chocolate sauce done well
 chocolate macadamia nut torte 8 adequate appropriately sweet forgettable

if id gone outback steakhouse paid commensurate prices would pleased results thus might fare better happy hour despite previous experience another location near ruths chris costs expect near flawless execution especially special failure overshadowed experience

i cant decide if victor bergeron real life trader vic following

 shrewd capitalist genius traded pittances mediocre food large sums

martini ranch girl tries look chic little messy like one olson twins doesnt quite pull off ends up looking disheveled little manic place just seems little out place scottsdales glitzy glamorous nightclub scene only redeeming quality live music shows arent too barsclubs offer venue up coming artists especially not big martini ranch 

in honesty im not much club girl scottsdale girl matter martini ranch isnt great outside live music offerings checkedout shaker room sad little pathetic weird stripper poles played really bad dance music theyve got plenty drink offerings somewhat pricey paid 9 rum coke seemed little outrageous although could am just cheapass 

despite martini ranchs awkwardness isnt horrible place hang enjoy entertainment quite mix people pass through place kind nice departure young silicon fakeness often seen streets downtown scottsdale

in end though if favorite bands return am pretty sure ill making trip back ranch next time may just stick 3 bud lights perhaps little less stingy splurge martini,3,1

a cute wine bar reportedly set old post office hence postino not apparent trendy decor lively yet intimate atmosphere perfect date group friends 

the happy hour tuesday really steal came double date each couple ordering bottle wine bruschetta arguably pronounced brushketah totaling mere 20 pair

the wine selection fairly eclectic bf rather arbitrarily picked carro red blend spain postino exclusive came taste test waitress did not assume man would decide let taste satisfaction yes felt empowered fantastico perfect mix smooth kick thats not too bitey intense 

the bruschetta came generous portions 4x4 4 slices 4 different selections perfect amount food complement half bottle wine each amazing gold medal goes white bean chopped tomato savory sweet tangy flavors make tastebuds dance joy

they raised prices 50 more dishes sides prices almost doubled example small rice 1 now 150 extra large 2 now 350 something stupid still annoying

also hard order food over phone tell truth sometimes trouble ordering food because dont seem able communicate very well english always double check order

the food inconsistent not great food still fairly inexpensive wont bother eating again because food keeps getting worse worse had 2 friends get sick food watch out chicken friend said got undercooked chicken place

also wont give out copies togo menu new prices so kinda just take word new prices used place we went often getting point im kinda just over place

truly hope dining scene reach point locating restaurant central ave doesnt automatically get extra star yelp love central ave strip am not going give average place like maizies extra star because location 

the space small cozy dont get night roxbury designed bar areait doesnt fit decor adds more light interior needs dimming 

the menulets start saying dont see place should aspire cheesecake factory levels diversity more not better usually more options equals more homogenized tastes less artfully prepared dishes 3 choices were great examples 

the humus too stiff lacked smoothness hope instead more line stiff outofthecontainer grocery style humus salmon salad good presentation lacking really salmon salad isnt something gets going back finally pizza burger flop had not seen pizza burger menu years excited try unfortunately lacking character tastehard accomplish pizza burger guess cant just fill burger cheese marinara sausage expect work out plus should able taste marinara cheese 

in addition cocktail list uninspired needs update 

the service out world literally im not sure waiter head wasnt work nice enough had attention span 5 year old speed memory 105 year old after day glue factory unimpressive

however cant really relax carolinas no one waits no matter transcendant food youre always hearing someone yell number 27 number 28 god help if summer

as food ive never had bad meal rice best city really moist without being wet chunks real tomatoes dishes cant get just everywhere like fish dishes favorite chili con carne very similar mom makes green version well red version 

ive taken boss out town dates well escorts same thing friends again escorts everyone were like happy daze afterwards blissed out like heroin junkies 

i think two were heroin still really really good food 

i love garcias las avenidas only 2 more months till 1 year ban lifted

location close does take back time diner type feel lacks service owner himself very personable however waitress less than remotely friendly least 

i walked not greeted looked spoken 5 minutes place maybe 14 full food plopped front waitress didnt even look direction say word bat eyelash thanked clanking dishes hit table 

the owner himself least asked food smiled mid meal however server after obviously finished just quickly placed check table left no eye contact no thank no acknowledgment am human being 

the food okay luke warm arrived front while portions decent other places provided much better service similar if not better quality food eggs were slightly undercooked potatoes under seasoned 

while cuisine may being initially restaurant service keep customers coming back knows maybe having bad day not even make eye contact rather offensive funniest thing about eager help other patrons just not 

two stars owners effort mediocre food wish had experienced same other reviewers am rather disappointed,2,1

still cant get over whole chinese mexican whachamacallit concept 

granted story couple combining cultural backgrounds lovely cannot wholeheartedly accept combination cuisines

first timers given taste tour couple items little sample cups meats rice out 14 main items include things like carnitas chinese bbq pork egg foo young jade red chicken sweetsour jen red pork sweetsour emerald chicken gingeronion etc menu httpwwwyelpcombizphotoschdjxllknwixbxpdwegbaselectbmdfyi4hlvw7rsjvzbhvq

for those unaware am not big fan chinese food so imagine dismay after realizing options coming bay area chinese food readily available higher standards did not travel way chinese food let alonefusion chinese food friends were eager try so was

food can ordered following options
1 rice bowl choice main item steamed rice too chinese pass
2 combo choice two main items steamed rice even more chinese pass
3 quesadilla choice main item cheese had quesadilla already pass
4 burrito choice main item tortilla only option

jerk chicken cuban black bean burrito httpwwwyelpcombizphotoschdjxllknwixbxpdwegbaselecteap6hgnvq6afmxjsonaa thought putting sweet sour pork egg foo young burrito frightened so opted safer choices jerk chicken marinated really hot peppers did not know beforehand black beans were also spicy mouth fire burrito 350 added black beans cheese plus fountain drink total came 8 burrito tiny heck did pay tastewise burrito dry choice hot sauces were homemade black bean sauce sweet tangy egg roll dipping sauce bleh

fiance decided go out sushi last minute decided stingrays happy hour we sit sushi bar every other time we always had decent service time completely different story 

we asked sit out back patio take advantage 70 degree weather worst decision we made day waitress whom we hadnt had pleasure meeting yet busy letting customers behind know forgot put one rolls wouldnt out another ten minutes after left could hear disappointment talked about good food service terrible knew gonna completely different experience than we were used after hearing that

15 literally 15 minutes later waitress hasnt even acknowledged presence im getting rather parched one point asked fiance if sushi buffet we were just unaware after jokes about service took menu up rolls marked off kindly found girl seated asked if supposed walk menu up sushi bar myself put order then asked glasses were water so could proceed go pour water behind bar needless say still took another five minutes finally meet server after confrontation 

from out smooth sailing we had little sushi rolls we thoroughly enjoy we discussed over dinner if should say something manager not finally end decided 15 minute wait type industry just unexplainable so bill came asked manager promptly came out acknowledged only had 3 tables corner should never long wait agreed thanked understanding proceeded pay bill never offered adjust way decided since wasnt adjusting bill establishments terrible service wouldnt adjust tip show server compensation lack judgement 

from now we always sit sushi bar because has never bad experience can see rolls being made sushi chefs way more funny sadly more competent than rest staff,1,1
we went taco tuesday 2 tacos mainly because first restaurant we wanted eat closed we were greeted server immediately tried push alcoholic drinks we came lunch time weekday so wasnt really mood get hammered we did order aguas frescas instead horchata jamaica either 5 6 dollars were hefty price served very large glass horchata ok had decent flavor fairly refreshing jamaica very concentrated so if like lot tangy hibiscus flavor drink 

we ended up ordering variety tacos not before server tried push guacamole around 6 we didnt really want first insisted best guacamole ever one best appetizers house soo we begrudgingly accepted since we wanted see hype about we got appetizer tiny little bowl covered pomegranate seeds tasted ok made fresh ingredients can honestly make fresh guacamole like home bigger portions way cheaper 

the tacos were small like street taco size came single small corn tortilla were piled high filling would liked see use 2 tortillas top each other stability because couldnt really hold tacos hand eat because were so full ingredients were bit juicy would fall off while tortilla fell apart soon picked up sadly had actually eat most tacos fork knife like gringo do appreciate generous amount filling though taquerias ive typically double street taco tortillas very reason ingredients themselves unusual ones wont find other mexican restaurants appreciate whole didnt find tacos too great tastewise had huitlacoche tacos first whole kernels fungusinfected corn popped mouth ate gooey mushy texture inside not much flavor wasnt too pleasant experience taste texture wise felt like eating bunch pus perhaps if were chopped into smaller pieces rather than whole kernels would tasted better since big kernel small taco can overwhelm whole dish

additionally server fairly attentive long something push came time get check no seen we had wait very long time before anyone came over table 

so mixture very pushy service combined tacos were memorable wrong ways make hesitant try restaurant again can get really tasty mexican food way cheaper other places east valley,2,1

wanted like place really did vaguely remember going mother often young get ice cream dinner apparently remember being much much better we showed up hot winter day wanting ice cream burgers we had cranky two year old had not eaten had not yet had nap upon first walking we realized busy were plenty butts seats not enough people running around taking care understaffed surely not sarcasm if couldnt tell
we gave name larger party came behind were sat before we were still we stood tapping foot child growing more more unwieldly finally we were taken into play room area yes small arcade off side children can obtain tickets buy little bobbles two year old instantly interested upon being sat handed water both daddy daughter were running around fresh dollar find fun made sure find out wanted before left so we could order quickly
quickly did not come daddy daughter returned before server showed up finally did show ordered food ice cream baby
food took about long figured would busy kitchen patrons not very impressed food alright definitely not worth price ice cream also not impressive had much better gspot even cold stone yet comparable price these two places
as said wanted like place feeling nostialgic only wanted experience restaurant used visit mother child daddy now can say probably never return

in conclusion unless good reason check place out dont bother not even worth nostalgia,1,1

am going give rumbi solid 4 stars heres why

the staff amazing helpfuland always far exceed expectations casual dining restaurant one example employee hands completely full saw dh reapproaching counter set everything down moment get dhs cup most polite restaurant employees encountered similar restaurants also top everything making sure tables bussed short time even completely busy effect tables spotless cleared

the food really quite good if dh dd can eat food satisfied no complaints hit honestly pleasing dds palate can challenging times preferring vegetarian fare rumbis bowls while very carb heavy filled delicious vegetables lightly seasoned proteins 

my favorite bali island chicken bowl feeds two days generally order brown rice nearly fills bowl then topped chicken sauce vegetables side sauce case need more rarely do 

the sweet potato fries crinkle cut served dipping sauce quite good another reviewer gave fries thumbs down not having salt well never served sweet potato fries salt usually found served brown sugar top if anything dipping sauce good fries were wellreceived most recent visit dd incredible accomplishment never touches fries

ive tried kahuna burger did not beat red robins version very filling again made two full meals 

this place very familyfriendly offering kids eat free monday tuesdays after 4pm 

i definitely recommend rumbi pleasing tricky palates affordable price,4,1

person travels lot really come appreciate very simple things return nickle dime program really something dont enjoy

i think those fees need included disclosed up front 

the efforts hotels resorts go order make rooms very quiet something else think we appreciate

at kimpton firesky location could hear water flowing pipe neighbors door open close dont know pipe every once while could just very clearly hear running water doesnt happen lot better hotels resorts expected 

at end hurry catch flight only made sure were no over charges meals room rate right ignored rest items hotels made numb different taxes resort fees

when got home read bill just felt embarrassed paying bill rarely do stay anywhere resort fee made reservation assured not one somehow firesky took whole new level didnt expect were extra charges 200 daily housekeeping gratuity 700 bell gratuity arrived after midnight because traffic so only thing bell hop did say goodbye stand drove off

am south indian background parents south india food very similar grandmother kanniyakumari would makejust grandmother would not make elaborate sometimes 

if were ask about food would say good grandmother cooked better 

as far wife ate breakdown

1 had mysore masala dosai very traditional mysore area india mothers side family hails dosai very similar would eat india though bit more elaborate

2 wife vietnamese background ordered spinach dosai said good used south indian food never really did see spinach dosai india before though 

regardless if person adventurous not expecting standard north indian mughlai fare place worth going would go back atmosphere more like fast food cafeteria food good

then comes negative experience now know do not look like typical nordstrom shopper am not raggy looking person either went tbd dept looking something knew would never wear normally were about 5 girls working just gossipping each other not paying mind first wasnt annoyed would help others became little frusturated then two pairs jeans 4 shirts holding felt little heavy tried get girls attention only ignored amazed even dropped shirt maybe purpose got nothing had one tall blonde staring never came over then young girl walked dept ran over help maybe being little irrational not customer service ever experienced nordstrom finally went up girl said much couldnt believe experience having standing state shock began felt bad end crystal did great job helping even picked out couple shirts would never thought buying before

precede lackluster review stating following

1i only place once
2i didnt get chance actually try cuisine
3i am sympathetic person servers one

that being said give place one star reasons poor service

about six months ago around 4pm sunday afternoon we decided eat place atmosphere warm cozy typical college bar collegeaged waitresses

we made sandwich selections ordered happy hour beers beers came food never did we watched other patrons come eat leave while waitress never came give explanation even get another round drinks we got ourselves bar 

since bf both worked food service we always sympathetic we can see place understaffed after hour waiting we finally crossed room speak server said cant imagine much longer think more professional approach would apology admitting forgetting put ticket we gathered we saw speaking frantically cook

where manager day someone noticed we sat so long without food communication all

we left money table beers walked out guess first time everything,1,1
good pancakes eggs breakfast burrito would say just ok not sure rave reviews,3,-1
typical greasy spoon diner fare should expect going in

i can recommend scramble jalapenos use fresh jalapenos good bite spicy other than pretty much youd expect traditional diner coffee hashbrowns etc not overly amazing not bad either we normally just go we coupon burn buy1get1 free meal etc,3,1
update august 15 2007

from october last year august year seems service pita jungle chandler has impoved tremendously continue eat about once week staff looking less gross well

i do say outdoor seating summer sucks would nice because misters covered patio misters dont seem work right do leakdrip water over people dining near results humid muggy environment makes wonder dont fix already

food still awesome jazz band great artwork sale has more intersting engaging past current pieces still nice

original review october 17 2006

its damn shame food good comes service bad really food pita jungle location amazing comes conditions 
its amazing if

1 ever actually come take order
2 get order right
3 remember bring table point during course visit establishment

the food good enough we continue go about once week despite terrible service dishes try include lavosh pizza both regular one glazed chicken variety red pepper hummus appetizer grilled chicken breast salad dressing soooo good salmon souvlaki platter dont forget check out garlic sauce

another issue about place drives up wall employees look like need comb hair put decent clothes eat decent wellrounded meal know im depressed so havent showered eaten month look ridiculous eating establishment allows employees come looking so tragic

but digress food awesome,4,-1
worked nords better part year so speak both perspective former employee consumer

chandler norstrom great place full great people eager go above beyond customers never had anything less than stellar shopping experience people werent top notch tended weed themselves out pretty quickly

aside cosmetics spent most time everyone shopped upstairs shoes handbags equally great 

my only reason docking star nordstrom not old school nordstrom something said about class prestige comes running location nordstrom way felt location often lacked

pro tip try mocha banana ice storm cafe itll change life,4,1

drinks happy hour pretty decent had summer smash tasty loved it

food terrible friend just got off work 530 were planning head over herberger theatre 730 show we were hungry excited try new spot out recommendation waiter we decided starters share entree waiter highly recommended tater tots sopes taters deep fried tots mixed bacon chive were bit salty not good sounded sopes were just terrible imagine rubbery silver dollar sized sopes worst tasting pork one bite took wanted vomit onto entree we decided share mussels took about 40 minutes arrive table no waiter didnt mention long would take even though knew we were planning catch show were ok not out world came once toasted bread think toast black beyond toast right not impressed

reviews read before booking little skeptical staying now experience can comment reviews shame

a words advise
1 if dont like middle club central party stay up late aka old young children dont stay here

a lot complaints about had do noise if researched area surrounding hotel would find bars clubs do expect

2 can hear through vent bathroom could used amusement purposes

3 dont need worry about parking yes clubs get busy night especially weekends spots reserved hotel indigo stayers if taken hotel pays vallet 

4 housekeepers great no problems went belongings came back too

5 cabs super easy get location most everything within walking distance 

6 hardwood floors amazing instead carpet

7 hint if crank up air conditionerheat night dont hear noise great

our overall experience great no problems 

would definitely stay again,4,-1

facility new clean take very good care ice like most about coming 2 completely separate rinks allows more hours open skating while still offering ample time hockey teams competitive skaters practice son currently enrolled kids first intro hockey program completely impressed coaching dedication everyone involved recommended program several friends continue do so without hesitation

on flip side think prices public skating skate rentals little high compared other phoenix facilities also prefer old leather laceup skates plastic ones rented sometimes during public skate hours feel like im being eyed overzealous ice moms think rink belongs solely little nancy kerrigans however son loves safe wellrun enjoy taking skate see friday afternoon ice moms just suck up,4,1

first off feel bad giving place just three stars after reading reviews really hoping like lot more than did ive heard months friends fellow yelpers about awesome place so we decided give try early vday dinner 

the atmosphere very very nice nice little cottage kitchen tables next chef dining area outside patio area lots candles can romantic place waiters were nice we had issues service group 4 came 20mins later than usjust 2 sat next table kept getting food quicker than most annoying part waiters kept telling food would come speed service definitely lacking 

as food definitely worth 3 stars except main chicken pesto dish just two butterflied chicken pieces pesto sauce no vegetables no special sauce nothing special did love appetizer 1 white bean soup side bread asiago cheese appetizer 2 barley poached shrimp w sweet asian chili sauce one main dishes pork tenderloin sweet chutneyhint curry sauce asparagus dessert just strawberries fudge brownie again nothing special

all did like experience food left thinking could more could better maybe went thinking too highly place am willing give another try not 1 would recommend friend

 wanted add something chris owner restaurant sent apology via email phone call says lot considering chefs get very offended if talk remotely bad about foodcreations admit feel bad if seem very cruel review feel not overexaggerating anything like think speak truth hopefully readers can appreciate one last thing chris pointed out chicken pesto had provolone cheese spinach am sorry chris dull palate 

again would like try cafe monarch again update next visit,3,1
first tried place last sunday went back yesterday more given im not much regular crave variety unhealthy degree says lot 

both times ive gone ordered la condesa shrimp tacos were positively fantastic shrimp great quality perfectly grilled bring out natural sweet flavor also love robust veggie filling including sauteed spinach onions peppers spinach especially flavorful unique addition sure only gripe tacos just personal thing each comes two corn tortillas appears necessary hold hearty fillings little carbheavy tastes 

but am kidding time tacos arrived id already devoured entire basket delicious nottoogreasy chips ton great salsas salad bar stop 

speaking salsa while like more traditional ones think unusual flavors most delicious example sesame one tastes great drizzled top shrimp tacos peanut one really solid chips both asianseeming sauces both surprisingly great matches savory mexican flavors 

the final thing wanted mention jamaica pronounced huhmykah drink essentially sweetened hibiscus tea delicious think tad too sweet id love if watered down bit 

this definitely new sunday spot course check back weeks if ive still hitting place up weekly basis know good,5,1
place tops ive member two years always member love museum once saw show about women fell love eiffel tower other buildings objects totally understand because am love museum

thank phoenix yelpers leading awesome place did we do before yelp born 

my family decided road trip phoenix new year since we never sounded like fun idea we were staying off camelback rd appears popular place most cool places we found yelped restaurants even though we were looking thai excited try cambodian husband honeymooned thailand almost 5 years ago heard food similar

we trekked out place upon arrival we were leery location experience know most best ethnic foods found off beaten path kinda dig new cityyou dont really know putting aside we walked into sekong night were greeted two dining hipsters were so nice just randomly decided say hello we entered like already

the place set up cool picnicstyle tables front had cambodian furniture decorative items like authentic look place tables had books about cambodia so could get educated while waited young waited greeted promptly friendly guy always needed something

i ordered red curry since werent lot vegetarian options were 6 items could made vegetarian we also got jasmine tea say had red curries places one one best bringing back flavors chiang mai one stops thailand seemed recall food being good happy consume again

i wish we had place san diego go sekong night if live phoenix even if visitinggo pleasantly surprised so taste buds made want travel again,5,1

the kicker driveup window do make food order we were half way through meal red truck drove up driveup we finished left truck still wouldnt want order anyone front driveup

we had anticipating opening restaurant months now we went last sunday apparently two days after doors were open public

we went around 3 late lunch we were greeted server informed wouldnt pho another hour since thats usually get vietnamese restaurant we decided come back another time we turned leave someone told waitress would ready half hour we decided give place shot

we ordered egg rolls bbq spring rolls took forever egg rolls come we tasted seemed like mystery meat took picture uploaded bbq spring rolls also took forever come were pretty good dont know food took so long since were hardly anyone else there

finally pho ready so server came take entree orders we ordered chicken pho combo grill chicken pork shrimp vermicelli noodles choice noodles rice were bunch dishes were not available beef pho example due soft opening once again food took forever come out normally pho get side dish basil bean sprouts sometimes cilantro nothing came pho grilled meat wouldve tasted good if only didnt over cook everything not mention came rice see pic inquired someone think didnt understand english so brought out we assume owner said because soft opening didnt noodles guess if we were warned soft opening were not fully prepared least wed lower expectations

we tried order dessert whaddya know not available highly likely we wont back even though closest vietnamese restaurant first thought can run out food asian market doors down too expensive get dining experience horrific server told grand opening two weeks so things much better im not sure believe,1,1

we decided sit outside we got early enough before starting getting too hot outside misters were so made very comfortable enjoyed live music patio rustic mexican furniture fits theme perfectly mexican blankets seat cushions guitar player really good 2 daughters definitely enjoyed entertainment

until 11am sundays not sure if always case so make sure give call before head great brunch try out menu items dont believe can order off normal menu during brunch top items available during brunch so should happy either way pollo fundido awesome well huevos rancheros everything we tried so far has delicious can tell am fan 

as 5 year old daughter big fan mexican food likes say after finishes up breakfast gets feed ducks best place eveeeeer if up fun experience great mexican food give el encanto try wont disappointed,4,1

full service post office located off priest between warner elliot come mail out larger packages buy stamps do other post office related activities 

what like about post office great saturday hours counter hours until 3pm saturday afternoons also automate attendant lobby if should need after hours help post office boxes rent drive through drop box letters supplies sale location usually clean neat

the only reason gave 3 stars because typical usps fashion lines usually include tremendously long wait times not people lined up out door usually matter 4 5 people waiting seems like forever ive stood line least 20 minutes before usually do mail larger sized envelope really doesnt take more then minute two

they do automated scale lobby new government regulations not items can accepted scales plus supplies dont carry sizes envelopes so depending mailing may better off packaging home then bringing,3,1

much love mom had seriously fight urge steal food
was because didnt completely love sweet potato tortelli mushrooms 
no sweet potato filling brussels sprouts mushroom were wonderful compliments each other sauce savory buttery not over top didnt cover taste veggies

no saved moms food kept family peace shrimp sausage chicken jambalaya skeptical ordering jambalaya outside nola excellent seasoning spot meat wasnt dried overcooked find frequently bad jambalaya proof chef knew doing okra maintained firmness didnt become soft slimy like okra frequently does

not usually dessert person really liked blueberry cheesecake streusel graham crackers did nothing make mess loved creaminess cheesecake another take brother found consistency too soft didnt think would stand up if done traditional cheesecake see pics
my sisterin law seemed fond bathroom venture confidence

my mother returned days after left had jambalaya so guess shes fan too

concept great one festival food trucks were no close prepared amount people showed up not sure if great marketing groupon were way too people way too food trucks 

if event happens again next year would advise either double triple amount food trucks cap number attendees would also advise having different venue get new traffic control management 

this day nutshell waited 45 minutes park little frustrating we were so excited didnt seem bad once we entered event we noticed right away lines food trucks were very long we game planned split up get two lines little did we know lines were so slow one food truck line get tickets then go another line epic hotdogs 

almost hour half later we finally get food hotdog cold obviously ingredients had changed little bit while we were line had ran out ingredients were improvising so frustrating

needless say we were able hit only one more truck each unfortunately we didnt go event separated next food truck owner truck gourmet frybreads extremely rude obviously overwhelmed situation we left hungry very let down 

i havent even talked about cost everything had no problem 5 parking 10 cover if things were way expected everything way too expensive experience food way overpriced 4 half hotdog 650 frybread beans really now food trucks gouging 7 beer well if wait tent beer 3 7 beer seemed like better deal seeing didnt wait 45 minutes 

i hate write reviews like because am just repeating others saying if decide do event next year am sure make adjustments lot go back great concept horrible execution,1,1

okay before wrote review did quick look other yelp posts ive noted quite people love if see rating know im woohoo category one seems much lack love comes perspective price if price primary criteria evaluation phoenix public market probably wont feel love tonight yes just like song however let humble fellow yelper argue joy wonder isphoenix public market

run well lots offer

i just went wednesday night visited evening farmers market first time just look things available local one location deli healthy soup sandwich premade items go got roasted carrots take home quite good along decent selection local items yes pay bit more butyou also supporting local food producers also small wine section selection local arizona wines free tastings guess well wednesday night go through another door coffee bar can get van buren roosevelt light rail stop realize not everyone can ride rail easily think being along rail line huge plus

not just providing service experience

look go place like half fun feeling part larger community trying new things helps anchor farmers market wednesday evening not only local farmers often music nice variety local food trucksits fun

so once again depends criteria evaluation ill argue phoenix public market offers something unique wont find anyplace else phoenix those might argue anyone loves has never outside phoenixive outside phoenix lot still think pretty cool place visit,5,-1

walking shocked see small room small bench 10 had squeeze even fit not very comfortable especially people sitting corner also very hot room so did not help matters

i also surprised room not decorated better just 4 blank walls boring

we had room reserved 7 9 know fact we arrived after 7 because hate late we were getting settled waitress told drinks sushi were happy hour great we thought lets order half price drinks so we ordered accordingly happily getting drinks sushi happy hour list well bill came everything full price asked waitress said told about still happy hour ordered wasnt happy hour anymore wow seriously thats shady didnt want make scene since friends birthday really bugged looked site later find happy hour ends 7 so should never told first place least told we finally did place order bad waitress

the room comes free apps sushi cool considering price room food good nothing amazing other sushi places town would go before going back drinks were pretty mediocre well names better than beverages themselves

needless say do not think returning anytime soon,2,1

continued existence mcfarlane toys poses trouble dilemma realitydefying logic par nobody ever seems notice archie wears same damn outfit every day

i never see anyone actually buying anything mean occasionally someone take one those overpriced abominations off shelf much anxiety staff check price tag before letting out bit chuckle putting back 

sometimes if youre lucky youll get one those mcfarlane virgins

oh god look kiss figures simpsons nd marines semper fi so expensive whose spawn

but again these amusing yet painfully commonplace instances actually generate profit store

i several theories stay business 

one more ludicrous ones involves someone call mcfarlane fairy mysterious eccentric recluse lots money comes store after working class rabble shooed out browses leisure perhaps takes figures out package makes dioramas out perhaps not

maybe mcfarlane toys really arent intended stores perhaps theyre merely toy museums let look wonders todd mcfarlanes genius 

after museums let buy work dont they

were talking about douchebag blew life savings ball mark cant wipe own ass mcguire hit dubiously break hank aarons home run record 

this guy doesnt know sound investment own asshole

what want know making comic books wasnt enough guy

at one point life did say fuck comic books really want do life produce line ultrarealstic highly detailed action figures adorn shelves gamestops spencers gifts everywhere

maybe wouldnt so bitter if made action figures out athletes kid

wait did were called starting lineups only people bought were parents didnt realize were supposed collectibles

and dragons great something match poster two dragons doing while gnome smokes bowl pot bought spencers

oh boy marines just need miniature toy soldier can hang wall look down not enlisting country needed gee like having threedimensional picture father

and metallica box set features action whine lars ulrich cries blood every time download song limewire

planning visit lux wanted place order instead found myself thinking about song confusion new order

their old location too cramped so moving next door part natural progression new space has plenty more square footage layout rooms bit maze unclear precisely stand placewait order were cardboard boxes other items over floor decor has own unique charm mismatched plates furniture furniture pieces placed so close one another practically need jump over bit much whats lux trying contemporary retro hard say even front door we walked turned out back door would throw so much capital into space without semblance clarity

the food we ordered ok had slice quiche pictured believe had sun dried tomatoes among other ingredients counter person friendly offered heat friend ordered two scrambled eggs hash browns two slices bacon pictured we sat table another room not knowing if server would ever find server later brought food over left rather quickly too soon friend show server bacon just delivered burned friend gave look if say could server not realize burned crisp somy friend had get up return bacon wait two more precooked slices sit underneath broiler while time returned both breakfasts were cold say friend happy coffee iced latte da bomb

prices were very reasonable we ran tab about 18 person out door tax tip we ordered gourmet stuff not regular stuff

the mall nicely decked out sumptuous tile floors kinda novelty dine upscale chine food inside strip mall restaurant has no walls just partitions separate u mall

i met up two girl friends lunch perfect saturday afternoon we hadnt tried garage yet had excited do so we frequent area often atmosphere great we were really looking forward experience meal 

unfortunately we were severely disappointed server attentive nice didnt followup way expected hoped ordered caprese mozzarella salad one favorite options menu shocked plate came full tomatoes two skimpy pieces mozzarella tiny piece basil about big thumb no way interested paying 10 plate tomatoes hate complaining restaurants being past server so kindly asked ours extra mozzarella basil frustration increased saw charged another 2 extra two pieces cheese 

my friends meal also disappointment ordered flat bread special day drenched grease made very difficult eat let alone enjoy only able finish half meal expected server least ask if unhappy food just took plate walked away 

as great new joint seemed most likely not returning shame because place really looked like had potential unfortunately food overpriced poorly executed lacking quality flavor sorry garageyoure going need seriously up game earn customer,1,1

so yesterday found myself without lunch work normally driver goes take out so happens just order something wherever going well turns out had brought lunch had walked fatburger tempe las vegas blvd several times had not tried either had time so decided make 15 minute drive over there

i did take out so would not away shop too long arrived about 1145 friday should busy lunch crowd todays economy am not sure normal statement more manager having smoke patio greeted way three tables were occupied two full one one person walked looking order board one customers came up two people working cooking area problem seems hamburger wasnt right seemed problem describing really wanted employees understanding trying explain manager saw exchange came immediately figured out needed next hamburger off grill prepared correctly delivered table manager apologies these days patrons expecting free meals future discounts feel proper way fix things customer not rude got correct fresh not reworked hamburger short order problem fixed without fuss

the manager then came over register took order sensing first time guided through options ordered fatburger less mustard plus cheese 449 onion rings 329 taking order hollered each item out staff complete took paper copy must corporate way do order ready about 10 minutes burger good not fantastic bun fresh soft consider good thing not succumb pressed onion rings however these folks found way squeeze maximum number rings per onion thin rings onion one exception were barely enough hold batter could not taste onion oil correct temperature so batter did not absorb grease off flavor would definitely pass onion rings next time try fries

overall not place would go out way if convenient wouldnt out question go again

are expectations too high 

should okay sit most beautiful storied historical lobby bar listen 2 grumpy servers one sour bartender kvetch about horrible customers 

should room keys work after shlepping luggage through corridors magic doors stairways

first review so yelp

a friend mine recommended place crepes needed quick stop eat lunch looks like just opened first am crepe fan honestly think can do better came expectation because food restaurants isnt always satisfactory ive stopped going out long time ordered veggie delight im vegetarianvegan had baby spinach red onion tomatoes feta cheese wasnt fully wrapped too much feta cheese like crepe everythings stuffed innothing spilled out ends liked simple selection ingredientsi would liked see more vegetarian options do create own crepe option wasnt right mood invent own crepe costs 350 crepe 1 topping every meat add 100 savory cheese 75 if really made effort design own crepe would ordered spinach swiss would slightly cheaper than veggie delight cost 525 less ingredients

if could come again would try breakfast crepe sweet crepe need sweet fix maybe thatll change rating 

i like design decor cafea nice mixture homey n modern feel itloove wooden fans doesnt ave alot character several oldfrench style decor open celings metal covers cool very spacious several black plush chairs lots tables chairs would come study since free wifi can find comfort here

i ordered iced chai soy milk surprisedly goodmost places dont make right

lastly customer service greeeatas soon sat down waitress came up asked wanted orderyou would think cafe typical one go bar take order also restaurant setting serve you

if not crepes id def recommend place hangout sip coffee friends if want steer away devlis brew yuppies starbucks,3,1

last year we tried out two three different vets after we got dog tatum mcacc not until we were recommended faust did we finally start feeling like we were getting questions answered no matter big small those questions may we love dr wiblin so patient knowledgeable supremely understanding speaking can really see much loves animals boy does put ease 

grooming also garners high marks tatum used really big problem groomers would come out tail wagging tongue hanging out night we would find giant clumps fur would lay we still arent completely sure would shed so drastically stress bad treatment groomer falling grooming table after switching groomers more than vets we finally found place seems approve thank goodness if we specify tatum needs fur trimmed around chest along wash comes out looking like lost couple wellplaced pounds 

the only thing cant rave about one ladies front desk every time pick up drop off shes rarely smiles tone makes feel uncomfortable if shouldnt after sign paperwork maybe should let know can take seat wait vet instead having stand expectantly only start talking over shoulder person just walked only problem office

just spoonful sugar helps pizza go down

i think little ditty kitchens motto place nellos old townnot more

i never really cared nellos muchjust too sweet sauce department tastenot just pizza pretty much everything made used red sauce kind

im happy say jac bought place last week changed name threw away bags sugar must littering kitchen

the result very much improved pizza centric italian dining experience

the beautiful carin met another couple dinner jacs last eveninga double datewere feeling social again

none knew nellos had changed handswe went back forth texts make sure we were right spotvery entertaining

but once we were clear things had changedand better

carin each had well made vodka martinifor 300 popmade decent vodka too

we had appetizersincluding very well done bowl mussels vodka sauce lick bowl good although didnt actually lick bowlmuch like actually dating carin tells should best behavior we double datingi dont know whyits not like were going home thembut good

the new pizza menu jacs offers new interesting artisan options including well done margherita bela dela meat something other wonderful

these pizzas were savory well made smokey wood oven were huge 

we had two pizzas ended up taking home almost 12 each pizza

a great value under 80 money four including multiple cocktails two big pizzas two appetizers

finally while décor hasnt changed atmosphere hasthe cherry top whipped cream delightful little jazz combo playing cornerat level gave great background music date yet still let carry conversation carin tells thats rule datinggetting know someoneso dating rulesi thought done thatnow find rules doubled double dates

if still need sweet red sauce hit ask bring sugar bowl tableotherwise drop jacs enjoy martis pizzaoh get yourself bowl musselsyou can thank see,4,1

everyone has vice am quick admit mine williamssonoma started off innocent enough would browse every now again marvel array products back then would never really buy anything would promise myself could whatever wanted once renovated kitchen took long time achieve goal eventually did then flirtation blossomed into first purchase torrid affair williamssonoma has raging couple years now

in phoenix biltmore fashion park store favorite williamssonoma location one fashion square okay feels cramped travel business seek out williamssonoma stores road one oak brook suburban chicago nice store walnut creek ca also nice new flagship union square san francisco like williamssonoma mecca four floors everything williamssonoma carries well artifacts chuck williams own kitchen like williamssonoma museum combined entire product line side note original williamssonoma store square sonoma has closed union square store replaced it

williamssonoma best products finest quality stand everything sell if ever problem take item back no questions asked give store credit if dont receipt 
ive bought everything williamssonoma le creuset doufeu fleur de sel french sea salt if love cook place if bake cook lot sure check out allclad stainless steel measuring cups spoons measuring cups adorable because theyre miniature versions allclad saucepan standard measures offer sets both four cups spoons 14 13 12 1 cup 14 tsp 12 tsp 1 tsp 1 tbs really handy items oddsize sets offer sets both cups spoons following odd sizes 23 cup 34 cup 1 12 cups 2 tsp 1 12 tbs 2 tbs spoons stack together into cute spacesaving group four sets measures make awesome gift

dont overlook website sometimes special offers products online can upwards 50 off same items stores drives bf bit crazy because thinks pricing should consistent across retail channels im willing check website frequently found number bargains online,5,1

well swore up down wed never take dog dog park most trainers dont recommend actually we broke took rambunctious new pup dog park tempe sports complex gorgeous park lots shade trees path goes around perimeter enclosed area loved we loved fact nobody yelled about bringing daughter sat quietly 2 yr old can one benches munching ice cubes laughing puppies about having pit bull plus super clean because everyone cleans up after pets also nice water fountain dish floor level so can give pups drink too

the only reason cannot give 5 stars because wish had separate spaces large small dogs rather large ive handled pit bull mastiff life made nervous like dog tan shepherd mix kept coming after puppy owners were slow respond finally after second time rolled pup ground make dive between closest set human legs could find we decided call quits we probably wont go back if dog otherwise other dogs were nice werent owners were quick correct,4,-1

creator concept genius chipotle sushi did take someone so long come up idea after up until sushi became trendy delicacy late 20th century actually japanese fast food

to navigate through menu just think chipotle pick wrap seaweed soy rice brown white then pick up three veggies protein then sauces toppings prices change based selection about 6 8 youll walk away pretty generous sized roll if dont know combinations work best theres small selection signature rolls theyll put together made spicy tuna roll brown rice jalapeño avocado chili sauce good hot

the food itself decent would rate quality do roll couple steps above highend grocery store sushi bar whole foods ajs frys signature etc not even close good trendy sushi spots valley

its not cheap considering fresh fish not expensive if youre looking big calorie busting meal theres just about every other fast food option within 10 minutes do roll if youre looking something thats higher quality can served very healthy style long avoid mayo based sauces then roll,4,1

let start saying american apparel makes fantastic tshirts im serious tshirt collector decades pay attention type junk because involved diy punk scene kid if youre band printing own tshirts par course anvil hanes newer brands like gildan ive tried awhile looked like oneita going last made usa company around quality shirts several years ago seem dropped out 

everything has pretty much gildan tourist shirts event shirts anything cheap free gildan can even pick up blanks couple bucks walgreens if like problem totally unreliable fitwise react unpredictably drier sometimes getting wider shorter twisting losing hem threads also arent very soft very heavy arent very highend 

i realize seems silly highend tshirt thats american apparel makes shirts always fit perfectly made exactly same make anyone halfway decent body shape look pretty sexy somewhat fitted without being tight soft cotton combed rich durable state these shirts dont form holes easily other shirts ive owned even heavier shirts form holes near rub against belt buckle aa do not seams always hold well

i can easily say american apparel most reliable best made blank tshirt available buying shirts online only buy prints aa shirts because know theyll look great so online companies now use aa shirts these days well so easy

so about store about rest well store bright full colorful clean blank clothes womens side lots great skirts dresses made soft cotton mostly just summer accessories really nothing thick enough wear winter cover meant layered though can see mannequins great socks leggings im told make best most comfortable thongs business so if woman want try comfy thongs give these shot

the mens side more unisex area because apart shirts clothes sell men super gay im not trying insult anyone just seriously things far too flamboyant even metrosexuals definitely expect rail skinny buy clothes although carry larger sizes sell jeans skinny type fun going look gold lamet jackets telling friends going buy see reaction 

the kids work hip scenesters hired look rather than work ethic thin level helpfulness varies wildly between not somewhat store very welllit easy find things models use advertising artwork posted around store look like earlystage bruised up meth addicts early 70s porn stars 

the biggest problem store really simply clothing overpriced sure nice wellmade also expensive considering can buy blank tshirts 35 bucks each online bulk sellers exact same shirts sell store 35 times amount 60 bucks jacket looks like would come 5 dollar hurricane survival kit doesnt spell value really think only good reason go would if were girl wanted buy thongs socks leggings skirt dress if just want tshirt much cheaper ways obtain both men women 

its great having aa location valley if no other reason than just smart shopper can do better,3,1

ive heard quite bit buzz phoenix foodies seen sweet republic featured television eaten creations several occasions experiences quite good several flavors including salted caramel mint ice cream made locally sourced ingredients enjoy overheard bacon ice cream weekends those know had try love bacon andor butter has painfully well documented

i dropped republic one friday night picked up pint heart bacon giddily headed home after generous spoonful taste course do do ice cream wasnt just something devoured whilst couch watching sitcom docudrama no heart bacon must savoredit must enjoyed must painted onto canvas can allow salty porkyness shine

a stroke pure genius hit id combine two favorite things new way breakfast dessert bacon ice cream topped belgian waffles hasnt done previously if has not had pleasure eating it

a friend offered whip up batch waffles whilst provided ice cream followed one tastiest breakfasts ive had while hot fluffy waffles big scoop heart bacon ice cream melting center drizzled maple syrup melt heart make stomach smile

the combination sweet cream ice cream salty bits chewy bacon little crunchy mapley surprises went perfectly each bite waffle each mouthful produced smiles enjoyed contrast between hot waffle cold ice cream soft smooth texture ice cream chewiness bacon really blown away good was

husband were way tempe sports complex play work softball tournament needed find place get fast hearty affordable lunch we had originally planned go mongolian bbq place nearby called ycs think pulled realized would probably take too long do whole pick meats veggies sauce thing we only had 20 minutes so get lunch get field we spotted gandolfos decided give try 

the menu huge really overwhelming especially since we were hurry we both just picked something ordered chose new yorker roast beef sandwich served hot pepper jack feta lettuce tomato onion pepperoncini butter mayo oil vinegar got knickerbocker had roast beef provolone lettuce tomato onion mayo oil vinegar salt pepper served hot 

after we paid we ended up waiting quite while sandwiches prepared especially given people were inside probably wouldnt return during weekday lunch knowing not superspeedy if planning go lunch make sure day dont need grab food back asap maybe calling ahead would help case 

also even though sandwiches were definitely satisfying werent outstanding husband whos originally new jersey didnt think sandwiches were nearly good ones hes had east coast yes know were phoenix restaurant chain btw has chosen call itself new york delicatessen fairness can raise customers expectations also thought regular size sandwich bit small if big eater would definitely get large lest think say about gandolfos sandwiches negative spend second praising hero roll sandwiches came freshly baked super satisfying 

i would definitely eat gandolfos again if were area had time wait sandwich im unlikely go out way,3,1

a side notewhere birds ready poop find somehow must poop magnet somewhere around because always happens

i am already stuck neutral still soap phase wash so sit wait count long takes before one birds craps freshly rinsed car course within moments dryer beginning green light flashes notice nice little white pile hood car make things even more enjoyable dryer smears freshly deposited prize across hood after wants wet pigeon poop car

am giving 4 stars am little skeptical about restaurants staying power know just celebrated 1 year anniversary something suspect about place 

i had dinner family brothers 28th birthday interior very warm dark appeared nice bar area dining area nice open did like way presented menus had leather bound cover fit very well decor 

we started table side guacamole good guy prepared gave play play had very infomercial type voice little annoying almost felt bad portion wasnt very big however chips salsa were good bad selection menu quite small if vegetarian no options had swordfish shrimp ceviche rice actually very good portion small eating out standards actuality probably perfect amount food pork chorizo hit table well also able try scallops were good tad undercooked 

here makes worry about staying power server diner ratio probably 21 we must had least 7 different people help out table we noticed lot other servers runners bussers hostesses managers milling about can afford pay these people oh yeah food expensive side

sakana simply great place eat small always busy waitresses sushi chefs greet door arrive thank way out simply friendly 

the place fairly small though not intimate one would hope am sure way tables set up may rubbing elbows locals while pop piece sashimi mouth literally 

the food good portions decent sometimes lacking presentation even size eaten sakanas time times folks out town others family friends am sorry say every time order same portion salmon sashimi portions were different sizes once sashimi served bed crushed ice awesome next served simply roomtemperatured plate least should cold known restaurant business long enough know course not dishes come out same dont want looking same would like see consistancy 

the specials good white tuna always winner very fatty fish so dont surprised very good though handrolls typically kid favorite very good big so order slow beer special comes 50 cents appertizer usually 4 5 bucks always good way get people buy booze

the rolls special great if season fresh get only thing ever returned sakana piece uni not very fresh so if know seafood had great sashimi before form roll alone would able spot soon raised nostrils pungent uni simply not fresh did not hold shape sign sea urchin should not hanging around restaurant

to sum up 

dont miss specials handrolls friendly staff
