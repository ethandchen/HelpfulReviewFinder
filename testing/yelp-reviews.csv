i also hope convey am still american heart hate panda express truly truly worship excellently prepared orange chicken 

be may instances suspend courtesy toward lessthanperfect food because product received not only poor quality insulting relative price paid experienced received ordering chopstick express

i ordered chopstick express family special roommates incredibly hungry foodie friend mine whom happened over upon reaching orderer refreshing though annoying talking seemed obnoxious teenager being forced take orders whatever water off ducks back quack quack we ordered orange chicken cashew chicken brocoli beef came fried rice egg rolls supposed come crab puffs were not delivered felt almost insult

all food we received lukewarm best cold worst chinese food can hold nuclear temperatures dont think snobbish assume delivery people can afford invest proper traveling method must admit major problem fact took nearly hour delivery person get means assuming food left fresh spend halfhour uninsulated dont believe ill get sick food considering being served very hot food clearly industry standard still seems sketch best disgusting worst



i digress rate food follows

orange chicken pieces orange chicken were about size mediumsized chicken tenders were then covered weak breading fried unevenly covered tolerable orange sauce only saving grace dish came deeply compacted chinese takeout paper box problematic dish because chicken essentially came out giant clumps 

brocoli beef easily best dish only reason advantage brocoli tender though strangely bitter beef chose use akin stew beef really thick fatty cut used crock pots stews because capacity cook ever ever amen resulted incredibly large chewy chunks gotta admit panda owns brocoli beef chopstick express could take pointers sauce decent enough yet ultimately forgettable

cashew chicken offensive bland strange sauce seemed more like cream chicken than savory peppery sauce am accustomed ate maybe two cashews share boring interesting note presence noodles dish despite fact we were also given rice peas peas 

white rice nearly impossible mess up only exceptional worthy meditation average rice though served essentially room temperature dried rice out

fried rice shocking case read review chopstick express please take note fried rice sealed distrust food safety practices fried rice cooked fast hot because quickness cooking never dries out looked burnt literally burnt seasoned something both bland dark holy hell fried rice should not appear dried out burnt dark chocolate 

egg rolls dont trust these were almost cold touch

crab puffs not present order those favorite d

my friend shared bartlett pear black forest sandwich actually turned out pretty tasty black forest ham julienned pieces pear fresh baby spinach mild cheddar cheese walnut spread just tasted like mayonaisse bread looked like ciabbata maybe wasnt side dish either french fries german fried potatoes we went fries 

everyone else got chicken schnitzel chicken breast pounded really thin breaded then baked fried couldnt tell then covered thick white gravy side german fried potatoes sitting really just looked like lumpy mashed potatoes lot butter

and everyone had something alcoholic drink one friend had riesling wine everyone else got either oktoberfest other german beer wish could tell ya really didnt pay attention liked choices though

the prices were not too bad example sandwichfries 895 giant pretzel 500 would paid more than pretzel

overall not horrible experience thought going think pretzel sandwich saved just sitting drinking water watching everyone else eat would go back probably not long long drive live wouldnt drive far even great pretzel however if live near just really like german food beer might place check out if havent already like said review may not very useful",3,-1

my order sweet sour chicken somewhat deceiving menu said going served tomatoes so expected like chunks tomato actuality sauce tomato paste based chicken shaved so super thin had weird texture 

the order garlic chicken exactly same dish sweet sour chicken two exceptions sauce duh main garnish ginger dish smells incredible if youre not big fan ginger id avoid seriously should call ginger chicken garlic sauce

the fried salmon gave best presentation served cucumber tomato dishes pad thai served steamed rice salmon chunks were thinly coated tempura then lightly deep fried looked so yummy 

looks however can deceiving

the salmon meat relatively tough yet crumbly tasted mainly like inside fridge tupperware

all food tasted particularly garlic chicken extremely salty credit do give large portions exception pad thai we took food home

just heads up beverages theyre pricier than most other places caliber example if want coffee youre gonna shell out 350 apparently think very highly coffee perhaps use starbucks brand therefore think can charge starbucks prices shrug

this place wasnt terrible waiterowner attentive wont going back just didnt enjoy food much

i would rate twostar experience im giving three because walk can tell owners trying so hard either just dont know theyre doing far price vs competition concerned think food much more delicious than do",3,-1

run well lots offer

i just went wednesday night visited evening farmers market first time just look things available local one location deli healthy soup sandwich premade items go got roasted carrots take home quite good along decent selection local items yes pay bit more butyou also supporting local food producers also small wine section selection local arizona wines free tastings guess well wednesday night go through another door coffee bar can get van buren roosevelt light rail stop realize not everyone can ride rail easily think being along rail line huge plus

not just providing service experience

look go place like half fun feeling part larger community trying new things helps anchor farmers market wednesday evening not only local farmers often music nice variety local food trucksits fun

crostini ai porcini these were small pieces grilled bread fresh mozzarella then topped sauteed porcini mushrooms herbs very tasty so much garlic sauteed mushrooms kind detracted otherwise delicious appetizer we still ate good we shared could feel garlic oozing out pores afterwards so knew wouldnt only one warding off vampires evening

 bowl mixed ingredients then handed chef finishes mixing together creating dish while explaining tips useful sure felt gyped handson part class wrongfully expecting 
 might suggest if take class grab table right side classroom because bring out portable gas burner table if youre melting sauteeing searing otherwise rest crammed around one stove up front jockeying position see potatos doing
 class wouldnt complete without obligatory sponsors so items being used class conveniently available discount out store

"gf heard so good things about binkleys over years people we know dined reading reviews online we finally decided we had try see stacked up against kai favorite restaurant phx area made reservations friday night memorial day weekend little over week advance since binkleys about 35 miles neighborhood we both live we decided make weekend stay boulders week leading up meal we were both so excited we both joked we were getting very little work done due anticipation amazing meal we were going friday night

friday finally came we arrived right time 7p reservation we were promptly greeted hostess promptly seated absolute worst table house bar area right next front door most insulting part hostess tried tell amazing table because vases flowers separated table front door were so pretty grand scheme things not big deal if wow food after we knew reviews atmosphere not strong selling point restaurant

after we were seated we waited good 15 minutes before being greeted server one pet peeves fine dining establishment like greeted promptly server offered cocktail so can enjoy drink while reviewing menu once we were finally greeted we ordered cocktails enjoyed were finally served being first binkleys experience we both decided we would go whole hog order 6 course tasting menu 50ea wine pairing has mentioned may other reviews online meal binkleys consists long parade amuses sadly meal more misses than hits amuses provided more hits

the big hit night summer truffle grits gf ordered hot appetizer both agreed these were amazing unfortunately most everything else relatively forgettable halibut fish course absolutely boring quail meat course quite good not something would drive 35 miles experience again

throughout night service pacing uneven sometimes very lengthy time between courses while other courses were brought quickly while main server perfectly friendly lacked fine dining polish disappeared long periods time especially time check several times over course evening

as wine pairings those were also hits misses pourings themselves were quite anemic long times between courses were several times had finished pour before course even arrived total 100 between two felt wine weak spot evening

the most entertaining part meal gordon ramsayesque fbomb laced tirade chef binkley went point during meal apparently kitchen staff wasnt doing things way letting know quite comical although little uncomfortable other diners around we could clearly hear every word screamed staff

when said done we spent little over 400 tip dinner while certainly wasnt worst meal either lives we both agreed didnt even come near cracking top 20 we were both glad we dined binkleys firsthand experience we both left feeling overrated perhaps were having off night maybe has slipped over years maybe just victim being overhyped whatever case dont think we dining binkleys future",2,1

 drunken noodles chicken if actually gave dish id more accurately rate however placed front chicken stir fried basil no noodles anywhere neither were patient enough take back make correct dish so we ate anyway wasnt spicy wasnt bad either per se not very memorable 35

 massaman curry beef im big fan southern thai dish done well flavors usually pretty distinguishable other coconut milkbased curries thai restaurant menu should point one wasnt really kind generic not very spicy either just like previous dish not bad not memorable either 35

 service decent non existent times weird given we were only diners room entire time also getting orders wrong theres no one elses orders mix up not so great

final verdict

so ok kind place started out promising drifted little downwards ornately done room very reasonable prices plus 

would eat again think so maybe had off evening nothing had bad

would recommend others if theyre really curious about maybe terms thai restaurants phoenix area definitely better ones around then again worse ones too 

thai esan sits comfortably middle pack

we ended up ordering variety tacos not before server tried push guacamole around 6 we didnt really want first insisted best guacamole ever one best appetizers house soo we begrudgingly accepted since we wanted see hype about we got appetizer tiny little bowl covered pomegranate seeds tasted ok made fresh ingredients can honestly make fresh guacamole like home bigger portions way cheaper 

the tacos were small like street taco size came single small corn tortilla were piled high filling would liked see use 2 tortillas top each other stability because couldnt really hold tacos hand eat because were so full ingredients were bit juicy would fall off while tortilla fell apart soon picked up sadly had actually eat most tacos fork knife like gringo do appreciate generous amount filling though taquerias ive typically double street taco tortillas very reason ingredients themselves unusual ones wont find other mexican restaurants appreciate whole didnt find tacos too great tastewise had huitlacoche tacos first whole kernels fungusinfected corn popped mouth ate gooey mushy texture inside not much flavor wasnt too pleasant experience taste texture wise felt like eating bunch pus perhaps if were chopped into smaller pieces rather than whole kernels would tasted better since big kernel small taco can overwhelm whole dish

then manager comes over did not ask see manager tells mix premade would take long make spring rolls fresh cant make spring rolls without shrimp kidding too long making rainbow rolls back deep frying tempura tell am simply vegan ask would recommend says vegetable roll order no mayo doesnt even apologize cant accommodate just walks away 

she brings out cucumber salad take bite notice has imitation crab cod fish normally now dont even complain tell take back just offer mother am surprised because right before ordered said vegan so strick two waitress doesnt know menu items am not high maintenance didnt complain send back ask taken off bill 

later bring out rolls appears mayo vegetable roll now forgive being worried not trusting competence people working ask waitress if looks like mayo point out looks says thats kinda green avocado so look again am still not sure just say ok walks away could not believe didnt take chef sure completely rude short about knows am allergic eggs shell fish if took said face value didnt challenge shrimp mayo would taken bite spring roll would put shock id rushed hospital if know about shell fish allergies bad peanut allergies rash allergy eggs mayo made egg whites lucky no allergy cod fish didnt complain about cucumber salad either

but server fries left lot desired let preface saying we had several other locations like fries crispy ask well done extra crispy scorched tortured hollow tubes whatever buzz word well done location comply every other 5 guys has complied not one tatum shea said corporate said not cook fries way so if we were put up soggy fries yes soggy then we did not want 

she also interrupted several times rude then went called corporate just double check came table said said no were not cook way seriously we did not ask do actually accused being undercover shoppers we started say something then again interupted

listen if explain choice not company wishes present product we still choose different way should comply after money decision raised rules 1 customer always right 2 if customer wrong refer rule number 1

we not return lost business hope loses job

two things people rave about goblets food well goblets only good ice cold really sucks youre served beer one room temp then see someone else getting one immediately after ice cold one because theyre regular know bartender name know life story im not sure wouldnt icy goblet served nonregular good way entice become regular 

as food pretty good most part above average bar food expect because more than just bar families come dinner theres separate dining room edamame delicious sliders good pizza just average thing really threw off were chicken tenders had worst ive ever had wasnt even real chicken merely pressed meat can get better ones fast food place

"now anyone knows knows creative side brain has little no activity being said am giving phoenix art museum 5 stars cant critique paintings dont know interpret different pieces sure hell couldnt tell different types painting styles used would really recommend visiting museum one day 

i spent couple hours one rainy sunday afternoon lovely ms m art student able explain artsy stuff upon walking into building immediately noticed architecture would love home looked like looks little cold side very modern sleek chandelier type piece right front very cool looking star wars geeks looks like alderon gets blown up death star 

i went see 2 exhibits particular ansel adams exhibit piece called fireflies always liked ansel adams since father photographer always had prints around house studio so grew like very beautiful photos throughout ones yosemite particularly stunning second exhibit blew away walk into dark room mirrors surrounding walls floor strings led lights multicolored hanging down go off random intervals feels like just staring into night sky mirrors giving sense endless space very cool would fulfilling had only thing saw 

there were others were very cool well one called masscolder dark matter piece comprised pieces wood church texas had destroyed fire being hit lightning pieces charred wood were suspended ceiling center containing larger pieces smaller pieces out sides were still nails such embedded into wood again star wars nerd alert looks like asteroid field millenium falcon had fly through empire strikes back last reference star wars promise 

the wall paper varying degrees reds yellows pinks oranges greens blues just visually amazing pieces utilize sides colored paper name exhibit escapes last one really enjoyed piece looked straight just pieces metal didnt look like anything look side though becomes airplane camera monitor set up perfect angle so can really see very cool 

so even if dont understand art can visit great museum try expand horizons just little know ignite phoenix 7 am looking forward going back hopefully able sneak around check these exhibits out again

stayed two weeks back january 2008 while builder did repairs ceiling luckily aaa coverage able get discounted rate room inviting tastefullyfurnished we enjoyed comfortable downfilled bedding however disappointed location rooms building had feeling we were only ones lodging wing construction going entire length stay noise not audible room while doors windows were closed we would always inhale airborne particles fumes walk through dust mud paintencrusted areas way room id sure confirm nicer location before secure room especially if youre using aaa card id give 1 2 star rating if basing review solely room location

2 warm not hot food manager asked everything we commented pizza wasnt very hot arrived table ill give credit marching back over open kitchen sharing thoughts matter staff would expected hot food guess slow service may had something do 

3 overall food prep were just things could improved example using two tortillas per soft tacos would keep together bit more leaving pico de gallo side would keep people like wife dont eat having scrape off 

one note guacamole two sizes appetizer size 9 side item size 5 we opted smaller size brought out chips plenty using before dinner two people so consider option if want save 4 

well give blanco another try future has right elements earn four stars usnext time just deliver",3,1

"overall experience mixed bag though leaning more positive side fwiw amc esplanade has two styles seating both serve food during movie cinema suites fork screen cinema suites has higher price offers better seating space ive ipic also let tell differences

positives

price huge price difference almost 12 cheap ipic

stadium seating cinema suites cant see people rows front back ipic theaters dont this

must over 21 everyone attends movie cinema suites must over 21 fork screen 18 ipic only age option 18 can bring kids

food service throughout movie can order food drinks 20 minutes before movie end movie ipic only first 20 minutes

on call service each seat cinema suites has button can call waiter waitress service ipic wait till waiter waitress theatre

negatives

wall height mentioned already cinema suites stadium seating huge walls between each row so cant see people front behind however walls so high come dangerously close blocking bottom screen youre sitting upright couldnt recline chair because made go lower made bottom screen get cut off back tried moving down couple rows got same effect major draw back probably knocks full star off review need fix ipic no visibility issues

food ive only ordered pizza very average everything ive had ipic has solid also wouldnt grab redbull bar ipic did though aside service good also good ipic also ipic gives free bag popcorn amc does not

quality overall quality everything seating materials ambiance design etc much much nicer ipic ipic takes another level probably reflects very high price amc looks like average movie theater better seating

food service throughout movie listed positive because day went had whole row myself however friday night movie packed could see being distraction does help do rows separated cinema suites also servers ipic usually hot chicks esplanade times ive two dudes

"let start saying american apparel makes fantastic tshirts im serious tshirt collector decades pay attention type junk because involved diy punk scene kid if youre band printing own tshirts par course anvil hanes newer brands like gildan ive tried awhile looked like oneita going last made usa company around quality shirts several years ago seem dropped out 

everything has pretty much gildan tourist shirts event shirts anything cheap free gildan can even pick up blanks couple bucks walgreens if like problem totally unreliable fitwise react unpredictably drier sometimes getting wider shorter twisting losing hem threads also arent very soft very heavy arent very highend 

i realize seems silly highend tshirt thats american apparel makes shirts always fit perfectly made exactly same make anyone halfway decent body shape look pretty sexy somewhat fitted without being tight soft cotton combed rich durable state these shirts dont form holes easily other shirts ive owned even heavier shirts form holes near rub against belt buckle aa do not seams always hold well

so about store about rest well store bright full colorful clean blank clothes womens side lots great skirts dresses made soft cotton mostly just summer accessories really nothing thick enough wear winter cover meant layered though can see mannequins great socks leggings im told make best most comfortable thongs business so if woman want try comfy thongs give these shot

the mens side more unisex area because apart shirts clothes sell men super gay im not trying insult anyone just seriously things far too flamboyant even metrosexuals definitely expect rail skinny buy clothes although carry larger sizes sell jeans skinny type fun going look gold lamet jackets telling friends going buy see reaction

"just ate tonight generally satisfied because im such consumer consumers need satisfied right very excited hear would vegan mexican restaurant opening phoenix unfortunately live tucson im phoenix quite frequently so ill future opportunities eat again

i really like ambiance also liked grimes being played loudly near bar fits im sure nonvegans label vegans pretentious hipsters not people concerned animal rights sustainability ethical not hipstery grounds such live state mainstream culture dominates ripped straight outta suburbs o california fortunately downtown phoenix seems heading right direction towards appreciation art music nonfranchised cuisine yes now im sure sound like hipster 

regardless tedibertos gets feel right service little bit lacking came get take out waited ten minutes bar before saw single employee first woman helped extremely cold almost like consciously intending cold possible took order cautiously uttered request two tacos afraid id strangled under neon lights actually sounds little kinky maybe tedibertos should consider opening bdsm room addition preparing mexican food itd opportunity beat cruelty out those omnivores amirite kidding

the second girl helped far nicer very cute imagine one playing grimes because seemed totally awesome totally sexy not worth based upon sexiness course 

i regret reviewing restaurants customer service general think whole consumerist slogan customer always right total sht dont think employees should forced wear smile face times pretend not human beings human emotions same time feel vegan restaurants greater need represent themselves best possible manner so more omnivores see going normal option dining out one does not require suffering animals human pleasure case not restaurant appreciate tedibertos open first place 

i dont reminder order called type soyrizo tacos chips pico side think waited total maybe 20 minutes after made order isnt bad cost tacos were think 750 pretty damn cheap if ask were definitely delicious hesitant seeing orange creamy sauce tacos typically dont like vegan creamcheeses case think sauce added flavor corn tortillas used were cooked point slightly burn edges exactly like chips were also really good well pico also had cream stuff also appreciate menu did not seem total soy fest after almost four years being vegan need lay off soy enjoy other wonders plantae kingdom fungi kingdom course 


so definitely back tedibertos future ill also recommending fellow vegans nonvegans alike if come back service has improved little ill rereview change review 5 stars yay consumerist yelp reviews

my favorite thing about bar besides friendly often hot staff atmosphere located park central mall right off osborn light rail stop so super easy get super safe get home dont risk dui take train if live near light rail stop theres also bike rack out front love riding bike down central kobalt maybe stopping hulas bight eat first thats another review careful leaving bike overnight if get too drunk though ive had wheel seat eventually entire bike stolen 3 incidents had left overnight times helpful hint if youre too drunk ride call discount ask minivan cab theyre same price room bike cab drivers take trunk too not kobalt bartenders wont mind asking cabbie call though 

the atmosphere great because has windows lot exterior walls glass ceiling highvaulted glass too so very open atrium feeling great place day drink because can enjoy fact daylight youre not just sitting dank dark windowless cave vibe definitely more upscale than phoenix gay bars without air pretention snobbery 

their patio great possibly favorite phx definitely top 3 bunkhouse bar 1 being other two dont smoke love sitting out weather nice large portion covered so great rainy evenings we get

as far entertainment goes something wrote lot about another review think kobalt falls little short hate saying because really dont want say anything bad about place theres not much see do chat friendly bartenders if youre yourself although kobalt gets decent crowd so bartenders usually pretty busy goodsized tvs theyre usually tv station sound off captions theyre playing closedcircuit loop promoting bars events slideshow previous events fun staff photos sound system kobalt good usually play good music so thats plus theres also jukebox can control remotely via iphone android cool geek factor thats about do shows love catch tc taylor awesome dont really think regular thing since no real stage dressing area like rock ice pics guess im trying say comes entertainment kobalt bring friends one best places sit group friends chat drink kind boring if youre own 

oh say though entertainment front one favorite places karaoke karaoke 2 nights week think crowd hit miss sometimes theres ton people sometimes just rotation usually goes pretty fast so get plenty chances sing bartenders usually sing too drewbie kela hope spelled right great theyre sound system perfect karaoke best mics town everyone just seems sound better kind like singing shower can keep clothes kind shame because hot boys go work there

crowd varies widely kobalt young old gay lesbian etc really depends night friday happy hour biggest night usually packed very attractive guys fridays get really crowded youd think new years eve something other nights just right not too slow so youre sitting yourself empty room not too crowded cant move 

so conclusion finally thank if made end kobalt great place go friends make new ones find most people go receptive friendly except snotty 20somethings think theyre hot only show up friday nights

for one thing six seven rats packed one cage 
1 x 9 1 x 8 dont quote im not 100 sure regardless details way too small number rats were werent unhealthy didnt look very sick definitely didnt look particularly healthy either 

the guinea pigs were really shocked though if know anything about guinea pigs youll know need lot space even just one cage same size rats cage were barely had enough room walk much less exercise popcorn guinea pigs do often were two guinea pigs packed thing way way too small one baby guinea pig also didnt look clean cages opinion were grungy whole place felt grungy grimy obviously werent cleaning cages everyday should doing would more unfair animals do anything least small cleaning each day

the prices indeed pretty good least better than prices petsmart usually go so theres one point petco

want customers come back heres good tip dont tell theyre wrong about something rudely correct obviously trying rush out humor even if wrong about something

 group lessons often atrocious too much time spent telling jokes acting like jesters meantime very little learning takes place people starting suspect lessons advertise public little know so take expensive private lessons 

 rotations during group lessons arent consistent increasing numbers couples wont rotate get way those do 

 beginners allowed take intermediate class might ok except majority class beginners so more experienced dancers end having practice routines people cant follow lesson 

 so much emphasis put male lead women dont learn part just assumed women like sack potatoes dont know dance long men know lead ladies sorry bust fatcat bubble do learn do part each dance genre 

 dance patterns complicated often too difficult skill levels dancers group lessons so men dont learn throw sack potatoes around see previous bullet everyone has train wreck

 lot gossip about qualifications instructors need work credibility

fatcat wonderful studio more community than chain dance studios can provide please dont let criticisms deter checking out especially saturday night because ballroom party excellent said fatcat survives because lack serious competition if well run large studio ever opens up part town fatcat could become roadkill",3,-1

the restaurant big very bold lots bluesilver accented whites browns decor very busy works bar area nice size just enough flat panels satisfy curiosity games without spoiling aesthetic restaurant seating main dining area varied tables long booth bench seats corner booths smaller tables mimic eating outside youre really mall personally id take pass having people watch eat walk back donating kidney exchange new duds barneys

those thinking menu about red meat surprise lot seafood dishes available lovers cow wont upset modern steak does live up name about dozen beef entrees unsurprisingly entrees mostly come without sides so extras want la carte spied parmesan truffle fries amongst sides knew immediately would part meal we ordered

poached wild caught shrimp simply amazing four colossal shrimp cooked perfectly then chilled served ginger infused cocktail sauce small herbs maybe micro arugula perfect start meal 

beef short rib red wine jus horseradish gnocchi very well executed dish short rib very tender just melted mouth gnocchi were cooked perfectly sauce had just enough horseradish without overpowering plate jus perfect accent dish mixed well horseradish sauce also split order onto two plates without being asked always plus 

parmesan truffle fries these kind speak themselves thin cut fries married truffle oil parmesan cheese perfectly crispy just delight pop mouth come house made ketchup heard could think chevy chase vacation ooooh real tomato ketchup eddie ketchup much better than still seemed lacking we ended up getting side homemade ranch dressing dip instead nothing high class table

sauteed asparagus parmesan we were lacking greenery table so we also ordered side asparagus cooked ok seemed little bland also cut spears into 2 inch pieces doesnt hurt flavor looked odd pretty forgettable side dish 

final take

modern steak continues trend high quality restaurants run fox rc food choices solid service very good location great so probably keep themselves pretty busy between mall crowd people walking over old town back because want try burger can order restuarant go window access inside mall menu options not cheap feel get quality meal money

sound quality 
its old music venue had carpet seats wall trimmings ripped out years ago leaving cement oval building sounds like cement oval building period

everything sucks about venue also whats great about get shows nobody else wants period nicer venues either too big bands know punk rock death metal kids dont buy anything so wont book those bands cuz dont make enough concession stands just business good news can get closer stage than anywhere else town 30 ticket would cost 150 somewhere else close general admission crowd usually not so dense so can get up front songs get out without bouncers plucking crowd go bathroom grab beer still get right back up front within song 2 everyone gets chance turn up front 

seating 
i saw someone posted outdoor seating just clarify picnic tables patio everyone goes smoke no smoking inside anywhere az cannot see stage tables fill up fast before show during intermission so dont count getting one 

note annoying people go shows early never go bathroom never leave go bar dont smoke etc get early girlfriend get right up front shes smiles holds onto rail front center guess im coming up front turn mofo deal dont get mad didnt pay extra front row dont own called general admission going pushing shoving nothing mean nothing rough constant swell pressure crowd back night goes territory plenty space can cuddle hold hands just not happen nesting get turn front center relinquish after songs so teenager can so so forth we know excited best seat house probably never seen show close because either too cheap buy good seats too much pansy actually make up thru mosh pit enjoy during opening act just fade out avoid having night ruined girlfriend pick fight gulp finish usually no stage show effect per se so theres not much see up cannot also see back row only 50 feet away anyway

"last times ive red lobster food has pretty bad particular night we decided go because boyfriend had 25 gift card gift card helped cost dinner still around 30 out pocket thats new 4 courses 1499 deal no alcohol 

we decided order appetizer calamari best thing we ate night new england clam chower soup joke really watery found myself having add salt pepper more flavor didnt even finish new england clam chowder favorite soup

next caesar salad good entree had grilled honey bbq shrimp really unimpressed thought bland dessert had brownie good portion size amount food had already eaten tasted good

at location felt uncomortable server never looked boyfriend came table coming over check constantly see if we needed anything annoying distracted boyfriend conversation we were having time we still tipped well both felt uncomfortable
