Very agitating to order a 25 x 72 inch blind (a replacement) and it comes in the box that says 25x72 but it's actually measuring at 24.5 x 72 and that little bit throws it all off.  Contacted walmart and they contacted seller but never heard anything from seller so got a refund.  Just agitating .,3.0,-1
I was so happy to be able to order these blinds for my narrow windows with out special ordering. The first set went up well but the 2nd set drooped. I tried to re-adjust the placement of the bracket to see if that would help and the bottom support of the bracket snapped off. Now I have no privacy between my front window and the street.,2.0,-1
"The blind was suppose to have been with 2"" Slat.  The item was a 1"" mini-blind.  There was no size of slat on the description on line or on the product.  I have returned and hoping to receive full credit.  Returned last week and have not received any confirmation.",1.0,-1

MY WIFE SAYS THERE ADORABLE. FOR VALUE AND QUALITY WAL-MART HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY GO TO STORE.,5.0,-1
The only reason I put 4 out of 5 stars was because the color they show in picture 1 looks like a Vibrant orange like a Halloween vibe. Well scroll to picture 4 And thats the actual color It is more like a burnt orange give me like a Thanksgiving vibe. However the sheets are super soft not a weird silky soft like a quilt type soft and they fit over my 18 inch thick king size mattress no problem. I did not need to stretch to fit that last corner of the mattress the sheets went on no problem and got very nicely. I would definitely try again and hope the color shown 6 out of 7 pictures is the color Im  getting! Other than that I purchased a very good quality set of sheets for a really good price,4.0,1
I thought i would like this pink color but its not for me i should've went for a different color other than that they're soft which is a definite plus i have such sensitive skin so anything slightly scratchy is a no go. This was better than expected like i said soft I'll definitely be buying another but different color for my King size bed if it wasn't for the color i would've gave it 5 stars also love the stripe details on the pillow cases surprised it's not on the sheet also,4.0,-1
"Color is hot pink, not what I had in mind. But is workable with my shabby chic",4.0,-1
Will not stay on mattress as the elastic is extremely small and poor quality. Stitching has already come  unsown on the pillow case.,2.0,1

"We've been shopping for Bed-Tite deep fitting sheet sets. Once these were applied to the beds, colors became the differences. They fit perfectly. The colors were as described. Several sizes were ordered and fit the size mattress that was purchased for. Highly recommend.",5.0,1
"Light is being used above the stairway to the basement. Lights the stairs well and can also accent the artwork. It is the perfect light the installation - well worth the money. With 5 lights, there are many wires that need to be dealt with. Overall not too difficult.",5.0,-1
"The sheets are soft and comfortable, but they also seem cheaply made.....there are already snags after one washing (and no sleeping!). Also - the color is orange. I know orange is a bright color, but holy mackerel - the brightness almost shines through my closed eyes! I was hoping for something a bit more ""peachy"" than neon.  I can't help but compare these sheets to the last set of sheets I bought from a different manufacturer. The earlier purchased sheets are soft and comfortable, but they are also very well made, and sturdy. They've been washed multiple times, and still feel like new. I don't feel confident about these new, orange sheets holding up as well.",3.0,1
This replaced a single flood light over a bar in my kitchen. I had to buy a separate adapter kit that allow the wiring to 'screw' into my existing fixture. Tricky to get device attached - you need three hands or a helper....but job was straight forward. Instructions clear. I wanted more light than given by the 100W flood I was replacing. I realize now that 30W would have been sufficient rather than the 50W bulbs I ordered. The ability to point the individual lights also let me light up a telephone near the bar.,5.0,-1
Awful quality. As I was putting them on the mattress for the first time they ripped. They will be going back.,1.0,1
"We installed this light to replace an old flourescent fixture in our medium-sized kitchen. It provides great lighting and really makes the granite countertops stand out. My husband installed it without much difficulty, the only time consuming part of the installation was getting the light bulbs in place (the included suction cup holder was a big help with tightening the bulbs into place).",4.0,1
"Ordered these sheets because I ripped a hole in my favorite set of sheets, and the only set of deep pocket sheets I had only to get it in the mail, put it on the bed and notice there was a hole in the middle of the fitted sheet. Called to get a replacement and haven't heard anything back. Do not buy.",1.0,-1
"Installed in my 17x15 kitchen as main source of lighting. Lights the room, although could benefit from 1-2 recessed lights.",4.0,-1
"Don't understand why reviews are always asked for, before you even have time to use the product! That said, I have not used this item! I gave 3 stars, inhopes the quality will be decent and that they will fit. Disappointed that the color I received is not the color depicted. They are a nice enough color, just not what I wanted! Will be keeping, and keeping fingers crossed, because reviews were decent and maybe once I wash them, they won't fall apart before the next use...",3.0,-1
"Installed light in my kitchen and my wife loves it. Not difficult to install however a second pair of hands to hold the light while one person connects the wires is best. I would definitely recommend putting the shades and bulbs in before you hang it as they are a little difficult to put on. The light is bright, however each light only lights up a small area as they are more like spot lights.The light I replaced was a three light ceiling fan with three 60 watt bulbs and they more evenly lit up my kitchen. That being said,I would still buy again.",4.0,-1
Used two in my kitchen as a primary light source -looks great and gives good lighting. I also have on a dimmer to achieve ambient lighting. Love the look!,4.0,-1
I purchased the burgundy red hoping to keep my gold and burgundy colors in my room. When it arrived I was horrified. It was the ugliest burnt orange color that I have ever seen. Wal-Mart told me no returns during this pandemic. so I'm stuck using this gross color in my burgundy and gold room. I usually have really good experiences ordering so this is a first for me.,1.0,1
"Went up easily on the wall. Glass shades are very attractive. Lighting looks better with frosted bulbs, but the included ones were spot lights. It is a little tricky to get bulbs into fixture, but hopefully won't have to do that too often.",4.0,-1
color in pictures shows a darker yellow.,2.0,1
We put 2 of these in our kitchen and they look great. You can point each lamp in any direction for custom lighting. One of the face plates was a little off with the hole placements but my husband was able to grind them to fit.,4.0,-1
"These are great sheets, especially for the price.  When we first opened the package I thought they were cheaply made since they were so light.  I was pleasantly surprised at how light and soft they are while being very well made.  They have held up well in the washer and dryer.  The best part for me is that they truly have deep pockets and fit our 16 inch mattress very easily.",5.0,-1
"The light is beautiful, easy to assemble and install. The shades and bulbs required nimble fingers to install, but neither are a major problem. Good product.",4.0,-1
"Not made very well. Way smaller than I thought it would be. Not very bright at all, I will have to install pot lights with this light. Honestly the only thing I like about this light is the looks of it. I got the black with blood red shade.",3.0,-1

"I have the 5-light fixture in my kitchen and the 3-light fixture in my hallway. They provide wonderful (adjustable) light and look great for their respecitve prices. HOWEVER, changing the bulbs is difficult as there is not enough room b/t bulb & shade to grasp bulb and twist. I found that wrapping a thin cloth around the spent bulb and using kitchen tongs to grasp & twist counter-clockwise was most successful.",4.0,-1

"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Everything about the umbrella is top notch in my book! It looks great, it operates smoothly, and it was a very good deal at 20% off plus free shipping! I specifically ordered this model because I desired an umbrella with a manual lift as opposed to a crank system, to avoid the breakage caused by over-cranking. Also, in that same category, I did not want a tilt system for the same reason - breakage. I am hoping this model will be around for years to come!",5.0,-1

"We spent weeks trying to find white umbrellas with white poles, but found them either very expensive or flimsy! We like white as they are easy to bleach if stains appear and still look like new! Colored ones often fade or change color! These umbrellas were PERFECT! Such sturdy and well designed items were impossible to find in our area! They are ready right out of the box and have had no issues turning recent windy spring days!!! Wonderful product... We couldn't be happier!!",5.0,-1
I have three 11foot umbrellas in a row across my back yard. The umbrellas are beautiful and very high....I needed the height so I could bury them in the ground instead of using a stand that blows over. Blue Red Blue - 11 feet times 3 - it really is beautiful! The double vents should help with any breezes and the sunbrella fabric will keep them looking good.,5.0,-1
"It is a beautiful umbrella which arrived very quickly and without any issues. It is replacing a 21 year old 11 ft market umbrella with a wooden pole and sunbrella cover which was finally starting to show wear on the cover fabric.

Pulley system...opened the umbrella before placing it in the stand to test it.. FYI... this is a two person job as I almost crushed two fingers pushing in the lock button. Ended up with 2 chunks of shin from my fingers gone. I could not get it too open for some reason as easily previously I had. Searched web thinking I did something wrong. No results online showing how to open. Finally got the neighbor next door to help and got it open. Nice product but again 2 oeople,4.0,-1

"The description says the sheet fits up to an 18 inch mattress. My mattress is 18 inches. It does go on and stay put, for the most part, bit it does slide up the side of the mattress occasionally. Its possible thats due to my vinyl mattress protector being a little slick. The only thing that bugs me and isnt even really a problem is the elastic band doesn't be go completely under the mattress all the way around. It tucks on the corners but not the middle portions of each side. It could be my ocd or the fact that the sheet isn't deep enough. The sheet set is super comfy and my boyfriend, who doesn't even like a top sheet, now sleeps under this one because it feels great.",4.0,-1

Sometimes microfiber sheets end up getting ""pilly"" but these show good promise!",5.0,-1

I would have given it a 5 star rating if the letter was attached to the mat.  Its a round disk that can lift out of the center and moves around a big. I understand that it was made this way to be able to customize it, but now I have to figure out what will glue it down and make sure I get it center and make sure it will hold up to the elements. Other than that I really love it and would buy it again.",4.0,-1

The mat was prettying much as described. It was heavy and solid and will serve the purpose well. The buying and delivery process was smooth.

The center safety hinge and front opening make it safe for children. I would definitely recommend this product to buyers above all others that I have seen on the market, and the reasonable price seals the deal!",5.0,-1
I looked and looked for the right toy box/chest. I did not want a cheaply put together toy box. Wanted it to last for years. Reading some products they're made with plywood!

"The chest is exactly as it appears on-line. It is heavier than I expected and so the craftsmanship is definitely of high quality & seems like it will last for a long time. I just received it so I cannot comment on its durability just quite yet. The only reason I didn't give a rating of 5 stars is because the bottom is just slightly off in terms of evenness and so I may have to stick on one of those scratch resistant pads underneath 1 of the legs to make sure that it's level. I loved the fact that it came already assembled, which is one of the biggest reasons I decided to make this purchase- I didn't want to have to put together yet another piece of furniture for the baby nursery.",4.0,-1

"While these are very soft sheets, I washed them right out of the package and there were TONS of weird little lint things EVERYWHERE.

Don't waste your darn money!!! They are awful. The only semi good thing is the color. Otherwise they stink. The don't stay on the bed and the minute I put them on the bed they stitching on the sheets ripped. What a waste of money. I will never buy these again.,1.0,1
"these stain very easily, i use hand lotion every night, there are now stains of lotion on these sheets.  the stains wouldnt come out even though i washed the sheets next day.  also they are not as deep as the deep pockets claim to be, they barely fit my bed.",2.0,-1

"At first, when I saw ""microfiber"" on the label, I didn't think I'd like them. (I thought I singled out cotton sheets only.)  But I am so pleased they're ""brushed microfiber"" - super soft and cozy. Good quality.",5.0,-1
I was originally looking for flannel sheets but then stumbled upon the microfiber sheets. Read reviews and people saying they are so comfortable and warm. So I decided to buy 2 sets of these sheets for the price I probably would have paid for one good set of flannel. We absolutely love how soft and warm these sheets are. No more crawling into ice cold sheets!!,5.0,-1
"Product arrived quickly. I washed them in warm water and dried on the regular setting and they fit really well. The pockets are deep and stay on the mattress all night even with a person with restless legs, a toddler and another tossing and turning adult. The sheets are soft and feel great! I would recommend these sheets.",5.0,-1
"I have a Sleep Number P6 and was looking for lighter. thinner, softer sheets rather than the stiff, scratchy, heavy ones that Sleep Number sells (BUT they are the best made sheets I have ever owned - Tru Temp).   Although these are thin, they are so so soft.  I purchased the brown and they washed perfectly and did not fade( SN's did).  They stay in place and tucked even when the bed is adjusted.  I would buy these again.  They are a great deal.",5.0,-1
There is a difference between cheap and inexpensive. These sheets are just cheap.  Thin does not even begin to describe them.  The pillow cases are not even hemmed all the way around.  The sheets are uneven and not even close to being squared.  Will never buy this brand of sheet again.,2.0,-1
"Anyone considering a mattress topper is going to think hard about what to do with existing sheets. Save yourself the headache by buying these fitted sheets first out the gate. If they seem a bit large at first blush, consider this. Simply tuck in the excess. The spandex gathering takes up the slack anyway. So when you get that mattress topper, you have the excess already.
The Walmart Mainstays might seem tempting at around 14 bucks. But believe me, you'll wish you had bought these instead.",5.0,-1
"one of the corners of the fitted sheet was not stitched, and the pillowcases were only hemmed on one side and the fabric on the other side was totally unhemmed. I have never had any sheets like this. The color was vibrant and fabric very soft, but was really put off by the poor quality workmanship.  I took them back to my local Walmart to return them, and was told by the customer representative, Ellen, that I needed the box they came in, but I didn't have it. Fortunately, they had a box and she put the sheets in it, and taped it shut.  I inquired about some type of paperwork showing that I had returned them and she said I would get somethin in an email, and to date I haven't had one.",2.0,-1
"The sheet set is made delux and packaged as if you purchased it from a boutique bath and bedding shop. The peach shade is dreamy, and my only regret is that I did not purchase another one. I need to do that ASAP. It came protected very well in icy weather, and came very promptly. I am very well satisfied.",5.0,-1
"Received order on time. The color of queen set were same as picture.  The sheet set is very well made and fit queen bed perfectly,feels very soft to touch.

"The full-size bed sheet set (taupe) are nice-looking.  I did not launder them first.  The color is about what I expected from the picture, perhaps slightly darker.  I've only had these sheets a short period of time, will need to review them at a later time, after several washings.  They are a little thinner than I expected, but the proof of their quality will be how well they last over time.  So far, so good...",4.0,-1
"I really wanted to love these sheets.  They are soft and comfortable, nice to sleep on.  But...the material is very thin, and the bottom fitted sheet won't stay in place.  The elastic on the fitted sheet is very small and does not do the job. This is a deal breaker for me.",2.0,-1
"I wasn't happy that the ends of the pillowcases were not sewn shut, but my daughter absolutely loved these sheets! First time she had a set that completely covered her extra high mattress. Got them washed and on their bed within hours of receiving them.",4.0,-1
These are nice sheets but donât stay on! We have an adjustable base and these end up wadded. Customer service is a joke. I contacted them twice for a refund and they never responded. Will never purchase from them again! Love my Amazon sheets so much more!,3.0,-1
"Doesnt look or feel deep at all when i was putting it on the mattredd but so far its exactly what i was looking for it hasnt rolled up from under mattress it stays tucked in the corners which used to be my biggest problem with previous sheets.

"I got the navy blue. Great color, great feel but the elastic isn't very good. The fitted sheet pops up and I'm constantly having to fix it.  I got these because they have deep pockets and was hoping to prevent that from happening. I have a mattress topper so regular sheets wouldn't cover the whole mattress. (My mattress + topper = 14 inches) These sheets do that, they just won't stay. Honestly would have took them back but I wash my sheets before I put them on. I'm giving a 3 because I love the feel...they are super soft and a very pretty blue.",3.0,-1
"My complaint....I ordered 2 twin size deep pocket sheet set in Aqua blue. The color was slightly different. Not too noticeable, when separated, but yet still different.  However, the size, Twin XL Deep fit was perfect. They are light weight, smooth and so very soft.",4.0,-1
"Great price, great value, super soft, colors true to pictures, arrived earlier than expected, fit our deep mattress and don't come loose from corners.  Feels like they should be more expensive.  Liked the first set in red so much, we ordered a second set in cream.",5.0,-1
"I love these sheets. I washed them and have been using them for 3 days now. They are thin, but not so thin they rip. They feel so soft and luxurious and a great price too. I also love the fact that the fitted sheet has elastic all around, keeps it securely on my mattress. 5 stars.",5.0,-1
"The color is gorgeous and these are definitely the softest sheets I own! The fitted sheet seems a tiny bit loose, even on my pillow top mattress. I was afraid I'd be constantly having to readjust the fitted sheet but it's stayed put better than I expected. I'll definitely be buying more of these sheet sets in the future.",4.0,-1
"we ordered the mint. twin size to go with our sons paw patrole comforter. the mint is not the same color as the picture. its more faded than what the picture shows. not as bright or vivid. but they are still very nice, fit great, and he likes them. they still match just fine, so I would be willing to buy again.",5.0,-1
"Really like the deep pocket fitted sheets that are so much easier to fit onto our deep mattress. Have to admit the color was a little startling compared to how it looked on the order screen, also they smelled a little strong even after washing before the first use.",4.0,-1
"I purchased 3 (three) sets of this set.  Each a different color. The colors are better than pictured, and solid through out the set. They are super soft! Fit wonderfully and did not ""run"" in the wash! They have handled being washed and dried several times and seem to be holding up perfectly. I would most definitely recommend and purchase again!!!!",5.0,-1
I didn’t realize microfiber sheets until after I ordered. went to cancel order within a hour or two after the order and could not as it said order was now on its way(?) To return had to contact sender twice and pay to send it back- I won’t be ordering from this place - stick to Amazon.,2.0,-1
"Not even close to expectations.  I can read a newspaper through them and they are just about impossible to put on!  These ""deep pockets"" don't fit any better than my regular set of sheets.  Too bad I ordered the wrong size first (never even opened it) so ordered correct size second time around.  Big waste of $ IMHO.  Too expensive (heavy) to return...can't return to Wal-Mart so will go to Good will or some such organization.",1.0,-1
"I've had them for 6 months and I still say """"oh yeah"""" out loud every time I crawl in. I look forward to crawling back in before I have crawled out. They are luxury sheets at a budget price. They feel great, they are cool and soft, they look great, they wash great, they are lite, they dry in minutes wrinkle free, they don't pill, they are extra deep pocket, the pillowcases are true queen with designer look and envelope ends, the chocolate color is beautiful. I have two sets that I rotate every two weeks and both sets are still like new. What's not to like?",5.0,-1
"Although they feel a bit thin, they are very strong, soft to the touch
 Washed them twice now, no color fade, bleed or shrinkage.
The Royal Blue color was spot on. I have purchased linens that have been way more expensive and have shrunk and faded. These are well worth every penny.",5.0,-1

"This microwave takes up very little space when hung under a cabinet but still provides all the great GE functionality and quality. A tall coffee cup or a 10.125” dinner plate fit into it. If you use the GE trim kit with care, you'll have a successful install.",5.0,-1

"I was looking for a good waffle maker. Decided to purchase this one and I'm glad I did! It is very sturdy, almost feels like a professional equipment. It has different settings on how brown you want your waffle. It also came with a measuring cup that can be attached to a bowl. One of my favorite things is that you can store it vertically to save space! I've used it a couple times already and very pleased with it.",5.0,1

"I was very excited to find this anti-overflow waffle maker. Having had waffle makers in the past, I finally got rid of them because of the overflow problem. This design is genius! Waffles were baked to perfection and I am very happy that I will be able to make waffles again without them overflowing. Follow the directions and you should be able to make yummy waffles.",5.0,-1
"The bed is really pretty and fairly easy to put together, as others have said. My only gripe is the tacks along the edges are not real upholstery tacks, but a somewhat cheap-looking chain of fake tack heads. Every fifth fake tack has a real tack under it, which makes it stick out farther than the others, so in addition to looking fake, it is also uneven. You can't see it from across the room though, and the rest of the bed is quite nice.",4.0,-1
I purchased this compact GE Microwave specifically to fit inside a built-in kitchen cupboard.  The enclosed space is too small for most regular microwave ovens on,4.0,-1
Nice sturdy headboard. Easy to assemble. I needed adjustable brackets to fit it to my frame. The color is darker gray almost black. Style is very nice and fits my decor.,4.0,-1
I purchased 3 to give as x-mas presents and kept one for myself. I like the anti overflow feature and cord wrap hooks. Easy stand up for compact storage.  The only reason I did not rate 5 stars is because I wish it would beep to alert when the red light comes on when cooking time is complete.,4.0,-1
"The headboard is heavy, sturdy, and the fabric is thick and well made. It was fairly easy to put together, although we had to re-drill the holes for our bed frame, as they didn't line up. My only complaint was that, as others have stated, only about every fifth or sixth upholstery tack is a real one. Otherwise, it's a strip of faux tacks. From across the room, it isn't noticeable, but up close, the real tacks stick up further than the faux ones. Not a deal breaker -- I read that going in, but just note that you WILL be able to notice it.",4.0,-1
"I think it's fair to describe this unit as complete junk.  Aside from being disappointingly underpowered (claims to be 700W), in about a year's time, the interior has begun to rust out, an experience I've never had before with any microwave.",1.0,-1

"This is a super Belgian Waffle Maker, and it performs much better than I thought it would. It evenly browns and the moat really does prevent over flow. That said, anytime you go overboard in the amount of batter your put in, you will have a mess on your hands. This is a super iron, I have yet to put any sort of oil or anything on the waffle grids. It really is non stick. Super supper waffle iron.",5.0,-1

"Poor design. You need to have a handle on both lower part of the waffle maker and the top. This one only has a handle on the top. This means that if the waffle is sticky, you will have no way to separate the top and the bottom without burning your hand.",2.0,-1

I've had this microwave for two months. We downsized our large microwave to this smaller one in order to make room on the kitchen counter. It's been working great with no issues. You can buy a kit to hang it from your cabinets. I opted to buy four screws and install myself.,5.0,-1

We've owned and have been using the microwave for a few months now. I also purchased the mounting kit. I'm glad we bought it planning to mount it because it's a little light for counter use and slides back when pushing door open button. I felt the microwave was priced reasonably but the mount kit was a bit pricey for what you get. With that being said both work well and we appreciate the extra counter space we got having it mounted. For a microwave that may seem small we have found nothing we normally use a microwave for that wouldn't fit in it. We are very happy with our purchase.,5.0,-1
"I love the fact that my comforter set was inside a vacuum sealed bag when I took it out of the box!  So I believe that protected the stitching and the overall set.  It looks great on my bed especially after I purchased 2 king sized pillows to put inside the shams.  Firm pillows work the best.  I have a queen sized bed, so I purchased the king sized set and it lays on my bed very nicely all the way down the sides like I wanted.  I kept my previous bed skirt on the bed just because its a hassle to remove.  The downside was the color.  The description said rust orange, but the picture looked more orange, so I went with that because I was hoping it was more orange, but the color is really more rust.  Although, when I open my blinds, the natural light does make it look more orange so I can deal with that.  It did have quite a few wrinkles, but I can get those out.  I did NOT wash it like most people do when they get a new comforter set.  Washing will mess it up!  Leave it alone.  You should not sleep on top of the comforter anyway.  Overall, I really like this set and I would recommend it to anyone.",4.0,-1

"I used this shade in my laundry room that gets some western exposure. Wanted light in morning and darken afternoon and night. It works well now, however some issues out of the box. The shade itself had come apart. The top gears are made of plastic and the attachments at the top of the rod had pushed in so the shade wouldn't stay together or attach. We worked through it, pulled out the tab ends on the roller part, attached to the top and worked a bit on the gear so it would go up and down. Note, as stated on the description, only pull on the bottom and it goes up and down SLOWLY. But if you plan to just switch between open sunlight and closed (versus raising all the way up) it should work fine.",4.0,-1
"Replaced an older GE under the cabinet with this one, it works great. It's compact and sleek looking.",5.0,-1
The shade it sent is beautiful and stylish. The size of the shade is not accurate. You would want to go 1 inch longer if you want the actual shade to cover window when mounting it outside of the window. It filters a lot of light. Not good if you want a bit of room darkening.,3.0,-1

"This Zebra Blind is the Best window treatment I have ever purchased. Beautifully made and VERY easy to install. Light touch to roll either up or down, perfect in every way! I look forward to replacing other windows with the Zebra Blind. I read several reviews and the individuals who tried to 'inside mount' made a bad choice and can't blame the company. These individuals didn't read all the information and could have saved themselves their disappointment. Vent on the cheapest vinyl roller shades when installed inside the window will have a gap on either end, the mechanical ends need their space, it's common sense to not know that.

Make sure to follow the instructions and not to over fill the included cup as the waffle maker will overflow if it's too full of batter. The waffles are a little smaller than my old Belgium waffle maker but I prefer this size more. Waffles are done in about 3 minutes! Love it!,4.0,-1

"I chose this model because I needed something to fit in a small space. It works well and looks nice in my remodeled kitchen. It's a lower power microwave, which I knew when I bought it, but in using it realize that I need to set the timer for nearly twice the time as my old full-power microwave. Not really a criticism, just an observation. Overall, I do like this microwave.",4.0,-1

"This is THE waffle maker that you will veer need to make perfect waffles all the time, every time! The machine is portable and lightweight, so you can take it wherever you go and have the ability to make fresh waffles. The waffle maker is easy to use and the control know is easy to use to make or to customize the cook of your waffle. The waffles comes out cooked uniformly and a perfect golden brown. The waffles made using this maker are perfectly crispy and the patterns are the best. The liquid does not spill out from this waffle maker and it cooks waffles in a short amount of time, so having waffles can be very convenient. I used this to make breakfast daily and it's also good to be pancakes and egg omelettes too. There's no excuse not to have breakfast without waffles and this is great for that. I recommend this waffle maker!",5.0,-1
"This waffle maker is outstanding! It has a sleek yet compact design (by Belgian waffle maker standards), heats quickly, is TRULY nonstick. My waffle come out perfectly.  First, I wiped down the unit as instructed, and plugged it in. I chose a ""3"" on the shade selector which is right down the middle. As I was getting together my batter, the blue light turned on, which means it is ready to cook. It comes with a handy dandy measuring cup so you can measure out  just the right amount of batter. The instructions do state that you cannot use nonstick cooking spray on the waffle iron, so I just poured in the batter and closed the lid. The blue light turns off, then back on to let you know it's done!  My waffle turned out perfect. Just the right amount of doneness for my liking and it cooked in about 2 minutes! The waffle came out of the iron so easy - it truly is nonstick. If you like waffles, this waffle maker is a must!",5.0,-1

"This waffle maker is great! It's really easy to use, clean up and store. Plus, the red color looks great. I compared this waffle maker to our old one side by side, and it heats up faster initially and did a better job of evenly cooking the waffles. The anti-overflow feature isn't something I've ever worried about in the future, but I definitely see it's usefulness. Especially as the kids start helping cook more.",5.0,-1
"In 20 years, I am on my 3rd move and this is my 3rd purchase of this or similar models. New apartment= new microwave for me. In my small apartment kitchens with limited counter space the mounting kit is a must!`When I move it is just easier to buy a new one.",5.0,-1
"We bought this microwave a couple of months ago because I was trying to get a little more counter space. We bought the kit that was suggested to hang the unit under the cabinet and it went up like a breeze--the instructions look a lot more complicated than it actually was. It takes a little getting used to the lower wattage, but we compensated for that in no time. This is the perfect microwave replacement in our kitchen and we love it.",5.0,-1
"I LOVED the fact that you could set the dial from 1-5 depending on your personal preference!

"We really love the Chefman Anti-Overflow Waffle Maker! It comes with a cup to measure the perfect amount of batter and it was so easy, my 10-year old made waffles before I even got to it!

Later in the day, we made grilled cheese sandwiches and the kids gobbled those up too!",5.0,-1
This waffle maker is amazing!! It doesn't overflow...it include a measuring cup to be sure you're putting they exact amount for the perfect waffle. The waffle came out perfectly cooked...and...the best part...there was absolutely no clean up!!! The waffle came out smooth and left ZERO residue behind!,5.0,-1
"This is a slim, trim, microwave that can be mounted under a cabinet, provided that you buy the somewhat overpriced mounting kit. The instructions that come with the product are skimpy and not very useful, but they tell you how to order a useful Owners Manual that you can download or have mailed to you. ",5.0,-1
I absolutely love this waffle maker! The things I like most about it is the dial to select the wellness you want your waffle to be (I found 3 to be perfect for me) also the overflow ring around the edge so any extra batter doesn't come out the sides and if any gets in there it cooks that as well. There is a light to let you know when it's ready to cook and another to let you know when it's ready to take out. It does make decent size waffles too. I would definitely recommend this.,5.0,-1
We already have an upright waffle iron that is very difficult to clean. I was so excited to have the opportunity to test this product. It cooks the waffles very efficiently and they are beautiful. It wipes down and stores easy and is easy to clean. Plus it looks very nice in our kitchen. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a waffle iron!,5.0,-1
"I'm not really good at cooking, but this machine sure let my cooking skill look really good to others! It's easy to use, the look of the machine is so elegant!

I'm really glad that I got this chance to try out this free sample!",5.0,-1
"The Chefman Anti-Overflow Waffle Maker is a really nice product. I was definitely skeptical at first, I've use a few different waffle irons in the past and they always overflow. This Anti-Overflow Waffle maker heats up very quickly! I always make a test waffle for my first one of the batch, this waffle did overflow a tiny bit. After that first one, no more overflow! There is a nice little reservoir around the plates to catch the batter overflow. The waffles were easy to take off, the plates are nonstick! There's a dial for your preferred browning and a ready indicator light. They came out perfectly! The instruction manual also has Easy to follow recipes inside! (Which I did use) Another feature was the cup/scoop for the waffle batter, it has two fill lines on it. One for thicker waffles and one for thinner waffles. I have used this waffle maker 3 times so far and the only time it overflowed was the first one. I feel that this is a wonderful product and look forward to using it again.",4.0,-1
"positive: external size and appearance excellent in kitchen. We wanted a smaller MW these dimensions.
negative: compared with our previous small MW and with our present GE Spacemaster, the edges of the door are poorly finished and frequently pinch or cut fingers.

"I ordered these rugs because in the picture, it's grey, citron, white and brown. When they came, the colors are more like sage and white. No grey and no brown. I wish I had known about the color variation before I ordered. Also, they are described as ""bath rugs"", so I just assumed they would be rubber backed. Wrong. They are not rubber backed. Thankfully, I have a rug backer to put down to keep them from slipping around. I am trying to decide if I'm going to keep or return them.",2.0,1
"So, I have had two sets of these. Initially, I loved them. However,  I now have two complains. First, after you step on them the ""pebbles"" lose their definition and the rug looks kind of sloppy. No prob. Shake it out after your done. In a family of four good luck with that. They also can get moldy quickly and need lots of washing. They wash up ok, but need lots of dry time and make tons of lint in the trap. Also, the two lightest colors blend into the background once walked on. Love the size and the look brand new so would be perfect for guest bath, if you have it or any light use bath.",3.0,1
"I ordered the color ""spa"", the lightest ones, color is spot on to the pic on the listing. As far as sizing, look at the numbers listed not the picture. Nice, thick, plush rugs. 
One thing: if you have any sort of balance issue, foot sensitivity or have trouble on uneven surfaces these are NOT for you. The pebbles are soft but the rug is uneven all over.  That being said, these are nice rugs at a great price.",5.0,1
"I just got my rugs, transaction was smooth, they got here earlier than expected. I was not disappointed, they look great, they don't look cheap, the only reason I couldn't give it the fifth star is because the actual color on the rugs is more pale than the one in the picture. At first i thought they had sent me the wrong pair of rugs, but its just the color, not as vivid as in picture.",4.0,1
"Bought this set for my bathroom thinking that I could use one in the bathroom and one in the Kitchen as the decor is similar. The smaller rug fits perfectly in front of my tub and extends out in front of the sink as well (nailed it!). The larger rug was much larger than I thought it was going to be and makes an amazing rug to stand on while doing dishes. The colors are not quite the same as the picture the darker browns are all about right, but the ""stones"" that appear to be very light tan (or even a little gray) are actually a very pale sage green color. It wasn't a problem for my particular rooms, but may be for someone whom has no green at all in their rooms.  

****On a side note,  my female cat is oddly attracted to the larger rug. She has never paid any attention to any of my rugs, and the smaller rug in the bathroom in no exception. The larger rug however she will not leave it alone, rolling all over it and its crumpled up in the middle of the kitchen floor every morning. Not sure what is causing that but she doesn't seem to harm the rug at all (not urinating on it or scratching it up. There isn't any kind of smell that I as a human can pick up.",5.0,1
"I bought this rug for my kids' bathroom and have been pleasantly surprised by its quality. I have been able to vacuum the rug quite easily. The length is the perfect size for my kids' bathroom space, providing coverage in front of the sink, the toilet and the tub. I'm going to purchase two for my own bathroom which is much larger with a roman tub and double sinks. Great find.",5.0,1

"This was the only model with ability to mount under our kitchen cabinet.  ALL models should be mountable.  This one is too small.  The door does not open far enough to get out of the way.  Our previous microwave had a HANDLE to pull the door open.  This push button thing is not nearly as good.  It throws a fit if you leave food inside and come back later to heat it up (says ""Food"").  No kidding.  Not a feature.  At the end of every heating cycle the fan goes into overdrive for a few seconds.  Why?  It seems like there is something wrong.  It would be nice to not have to use the turntable all the time.  Disappointing compared to GE Spacemaker II model we had before.",3.0,-1

"We were really excited when Buzzagent chose us to try the Chefman Waffle Maker because our family is really big on waffles! Now, people can be pretty picky about their waffles. Some people like soft waffles, some like their waffles more on the crispy side, then there's people like myself who have to make things REALLY complicated by preferring theirs soft and fluffy on the inside with just the right amount of crisp to the outside. I think that's probably my favorite feature of the Chefman Waffle Maker...it has six settings to choose from so that you can cook them to the exact consistency that you prefer. Chefman included a fancy little measuring cup that can hang onto the side of the bowl which makes filling and pouring the mix super convenient.  Another really cool feature of The Chefman Waffle Maker is the overflow chamber. As long as you are careful to avoid filling the included measuring cup past the fill line, the mix will not overflow when you close the waffle maker. This is a great addition to an already impressive product as cleaning up that sticky waffle mix is one of my LEAST favorite parts of making waffles!  It took about five minutes to heat all the way up but once it did, I was pumping out waffles in no time! The quick cook time was awesome and a real time saver, especially when cooking for a family of five!   The non-stick coating made cleanup a breeze and eliminated the irritation of having to scrape the waffles or waffle remnants off the maker as I've had to do with other models.  Overall, this is a really well made, sturdy product that Chefman put a lot of thought into. I really love mine and could never go back to my old waffle maker!",5.0,-1

This one does not have that problem.",4.0,-1

"The Chefman wafflemaker is a sleek looking, efficient wafflemaker that makes a quality waffle. The best part is that with the overflow protection it is super clean to use and clean up. The waffle doesn't stick and if you go over the edges no worries, it doesn't drip all down the sides, making an awful mess. This will certainly become my go to waffle maker!",5.0,-1
"The very first waffle I made did overflow, but that was because I overfilled the waffle maker.  On the second attempt, I used the included measuring cup to determine how much a good fill looked like.  The waffle came out perfectly!  Every waffle after that was just as amazing as the one before it.  This has definitely replaced my old waffle maker, and will definitely get much more use.",5.0,-1
"We have limited space in our kitchen  and trouble finding a microwave that can be mounted under a cabinet to save counter space. This was easy to install, it’s  very compact and was  a good buy.

"This is such an amazing waffle maker, out of all the ones I've tried this has been the only one that hasn't given an overflow of batter. Its comes with a measuring cup thats amazing to pour. I also enjoy that the light turns blue when its ready. I highly recommend this waffle maker",5.0,-1
I loved this waffle maker way more than my old Oyster. This one has an overflow channel and a measuring cup which helps measure the exact amount of batter needed. It also has two lights one for heating/ready and one for done. My previous waffle maker only had one light. The temperature control is also very sturdy and clearly marked.,5.0,-1
"Overall this is an excellent waffle maker. First off it is the perfect size for storage and very easy to use. I like that it comes with the measuring cup so you know exactly how much batter you need. Once you pour in the batter, all you need to do is close it and wait for the green light to come back on and your waffle is ready. There even is an overflow lip, so in case you do pour to much it flows and cooks in there instead of dripping out the sides. So in all I really enjoy this waffle maker and highly recommend it.",5.0,-1
"Looks good, feels like quality.",5.0,-1
This is an awesome waffle maker for every day use. We made some waffle cookies with icing on them and it was very simple to divide them into the four slots to make individual cookies instead of making a whole waffle. It made them super quickly as well! We had waffles in 2 minutes on the press. The only thing I noticed to watch out for was that it gets very hot at the end of making them so you really need to let it cool before you touch the outside of it to clean it. I would definitely recommend this to others and love how easy it is to make breakfast for my daughter this way as well.,5.0,-1

"I bought this microwave about three weeks ago to replace an older full size GE brand microwave. The old one worked great still, and that heavily influenced ur decision to buy another GE brand microwave, but we're getting ready to remodel our kitchen and we really wanted one we could get off the counter. There are no cabinets over our range so an over-the-range style micro was out. The size of this unit is great, it's just large enough to place an 11"" dinner plate in it without having to tip the plate and it cooks much faster than I expected for the listed wattage. One reviewer said to double the time given on the food package for heating but we haven't found that to be the case at all. I've had to add 10-15% more time than I was used to and it's done. I like that I can silence the beeps if I want to and I like the express cook buttons too. It does seem to be a little louder than our old one, but I think that the larger case on the old one blocked more noise. It's not objectionably loud though. One reviewer stated that the buttons are hard to read, I would agree with that, but, once I got used to where the time cook, start, and cancel buttons were it's really a non-issue. I like that the timer can be used even when the oven is in operation.",5.0,-1

And the Chefman model is great. The measuring cup ensures you use the perfect amount of batter every time. The darkness knob setting helps you make the type of waffle you like best (middle setting has worked for us so far). And the blue indicator light lets you know when your waffle is done.  The nonstick surface is simple easy to wipe down with just a wet cloth.  And it's small, light, and so much easier to store than our last waffle iron. Note: we did receive this waffle iron for free in exchange for a review.  But I can legitimately say we love it, will be getting rid of our old waffle iron, and will be using this one exclusively going forward. And will be making waffles more often because it is so easy all around.",5.0,-1
"I love the sheets, the fitted sheets have nice deep corners and fit well.  They have a nice satin feeling.  Come with 4 pillow cases which is nice since my husband and I both use 2 pillows.  They are great for the price.  And since 1 is solid and the other printed you can mix them which is fun too.",5.0,-1

"This is a replacement for another one I had. I only installed it Dec. 31, so I haven't had much use out of it. But so far, isn't real loud, boils my coffee/tea, etc.. that's really all I'll be using it for. I only wanted 700watt because of my outlets, so this works for me.",5.0,-1

"I received my Chefman Anti-Overflow Waffle Maker during our lockdown.  It's a beautiful red color which really thrilled me! I was excited to use it.   My first batch of waffles the batter was too thick and made it was very hard to get a consistent product all the way around the waffle.  The first batch went into the garbage.   The second batch after a google search was a bit better... I thinned out my batter and the waffles cooked better and we were able to eat them (with ice cream!!!!!).   They say anti-overflow and it's ok... it's not great.  I think that they could have done better with this idea.    I have a older different brand of waffle maker in my cabinet that seems to be easier to work, cooks more evenly & is easier to clean!  I don't think I would go out & buy this product!  Although; the flashy color would sell me & then I'd be disappointed!    They tried to reinvent the curve with this waffle maker and it didn't work!!",3.0,-1

"What intrigued me was the ""anti-flow"" feature, where excess batter does not slip out onto the counter. I am a culprit of this. I can never measure a portion accurately, and batter spills out onto the counter. This product was a lifesaver. It truly keeps all batter in place. The waffles cook up golden brown and crisp. I appreciated the shade selector, especially because I like waffles on the ""well-done"" side. The waffle maker does a wonderful job of being non-stick. I did not need any kind of cooking spray or butter.",5.0,-1

"The Chefman waffle maker by far meets all of my expectations. The waffle maker does not take up a lot of space and the anti-overflow design ensured a Mess-Free experience.  The toast settings allowed me to customize the doneness of each waffle, and every waffle came out perfectly!  Due to the non-stick design, no batter was left behind and cleaning the outside was a breeze! Now homemade waffles and their associated messes are a thing of the past!",5.0,-1

"I got a Free Chefman Waffle Maker in exchange of my honest review.  I love it as soon as I open the box, I got the red color, very nice color and looks very fancy on my kitchen.  It makes the perfect waffles, my whole family loves them. I like that it has the indicator lights and I can choose a temperature setting for the waffle. It is amazing that nothing stuck to the surface and it's so easy to use and clean up. Compare with my older waffle maker I dont have to use spray oil which is great no more mess to clean it up. Plus the storage is easier since I can either lay it flat or stand it on its backside. I highly recommend this product for anyone looking to purchase a waffle maker.",5.0,-1

"I LOVE this waffle maker. First off it is RED and I am currently decorating my kitchen with red appliances. The no spill anti overflow is awesome. I like that it doesn't take too long to heat up. There is a red light to indicate it is on. There are 6 settings to get your desired waffle. The spill overflow works if you actually measure your waffle batter correctly. When I made my first waffle I didn't pay attention to the thickness lines on the measuring cup and I put too much batter in and it overflowed. After that I paid better attention and didn't have any issues. Over all I really like it. I am happy with the way it works, I didn't find any issues with the quality and it makes waffles just the way we like them. I highly recommend this item.",5.0,-1

It's a great waffle maker and I love the idea of the anti overflow. When making waffles I used the cup provided in the box and I would measure the batter in between the two markings on the cup (thin and thick) and pour it into the maker close the lid and as the waffle is cooking the batter was still overflowing out of the maker and the anti flow didn't work as designed. One thing I would change are the on and ready lights on the maker as well. They were a little dim and I couldn't see the lights very well. Overall I would pay full price for this item and I would recommend it,4.0,-1

Have only used this for a few days but so far am very pleased with its performance.  After many years of a profile ge I wanted to update but to a smaller size.  The size is just what I wanted and the various choices for heating irvrejesting are good.  The only reason I am not giving it 6 stars is for its design.  The way the door opens - a push button that causes the door to open is placed so that the opening door hits your hand unless you are very careful and the general design is very unappealing as the size of the glass opening is not proportional to the surround.  It is in my opinion ugly.  Certainly this is function over form in this case.,4.0,-1

I was and am, as well. Meaning, I've bought microfiber sheets before and once I got them home and tried using them found out they were horrible, thin, non-fitting wastes of money. These sheets are the exact opposite of that. To give you an idea of the thickness and feel- if you have any higher end hypo-allergenic pillow protectors, they are comparable to that. They are soft, thicker than I expected, wash well and fit on my pillow top mattress that I have also placed a 1 1/2 inch memory foam topper on.

If I can give these rugs zero stars I would. They are the worst rugs I have ever purchased. It states machine washable but you better have an industrial size lint catcher in your washer to collect all the strings lint and pieces of the rug that fall off.

Completely satisfied with this pair of scatter rugs. Been looking for something for 3 years that I love. This is it. The design fit with the odd color scheme in my new home's lower bathroom. The color I chose was khaki. There is a very slight defect in some of the design but not very noticeable. It is a soft rug with a light anti-slip backing on them. I wanted this feature or no backing so it wouldn't be a hassle to dry them. They are brand new so I haven't washed them yet. I think they are going to be my favorite rugs for a long time. My daughter liked them and ordered 2 sets for herself and because of that I decided to order another 2 sets for myself because of the clearance price. They are just right in thickness keeping feet away from the cold ceramic tile underneath. The varigated colors pop against the tile I have.,4.0,-1

The color is softer than pictured but it works beautifully in the setting. I would buy them again and would recommend them to friends.",5.0,-1

"Purchased this rug and it matched beautifully with my bathroom design. However, the rug catches a ton of dirt. I am constantly vacuuming/washing it. Rug does not have a good backing and slides all over my ceramic tile. Also, the rug is on the thinner side and does not have the ""plushy"", soft rug feel under your feet. It is absorbant and looks nice when it is not dirty.",3.0,-1

When you ruffle it, you can sometimes see the bottom and it looks like it is missing plush on top. Have not tried to wash it yet, but i suspect it won't hold up. For the price though, i guess it is ok. Probably something i have to change every year.",3.0,-1

"We wanted to make sure we liked the style before we purchased others so we ordered a runner for our bathtub.   After receiving it we ordered another runner for our sink area and 2 of the smaller rugs for our shower, and commode,  I THINK the smaller ones were  34 x 22, They work perfectly and we really like them. The one thing I wish they had is a little more padding. The cost for these were $70 vs $300 at a department store so I guess you get what you pay for.   I would recommend these to someone that wants  cute but don't want to spend a lot of money.  I'll enjoy mine!!!",4.0,-1

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've been eyeing this set for a while now for a spare bedroom and finally ordered it. SO glad that I did! It's fantastic quality and looks amazing in the bedroom. I love that it's a cotton comforter and not a rayon type material that will easily pull like so many others out there now. The colors are slightly different than they appear online - the blues are a little brighter but it's beautiful. Definitely very pleased with this purchase!,5.0,-1

Iâm so disappointed with this purchase- the header discription for this product states âDurable Outdoor Cushionâ and naturally you would think it would be somewhat water repellant BUT it isnât! Why would it be considered durable if it canât even repel water. Now my old outdoor cushion is inside this cover soaking wet and not drying out because of the âdurable coverâ! I highly recommend that âOutdoorâ be taken off the header for this cushion cover because it does NOT need to be used outdoors! I would not recommend this item for an outdoor cushion and wish I would have never wasted my money on it!,1.0,1

"This desk is not only cute but also chic. 
The desk came in well packaged and on time(actually before the tentative delivery day) which is awesome. Because I wanted to set up my office as soon as possible. The desk was easy to put together and didn't need any extra tools to assemble. The instruction paper was bit confusing but the parts are super easy to figure out how to assemble without instructions. It is perfect for a small to medium size office. I was able to put 3 of my computers on it yet had good enough space. The price is not bad. I have attached pictures here for future possible buyers so they know how does it looks like in small to medium office.",5.0,-1

"We had had (most of) a set of Colonial Mills braided rugs in our home for more than 30 years and when the last one finally needed to be replaced, I was delighted to see that the company was still in business and still making braided rugs. Unfortunately, over the years that quality has gone down. For weeks now, we have been living with the small clumps of wool that are abraded from foot traffic coming from those rugs that are located in the kitchen and hallways. Also, the end of the run of braiding sticks out like a sore thumb from the rest of the rug instead of being smoothly worked into the rug so as to form a rounded oval instead of an ill-fitting, abrupt end to the braid. Most disappointing is that unlike the earlier rugs, the braiding is obviously looser because our dogs are able to pull up loops of the yarn without much trouble. Probably would not choose Colonial Mills again, although if I didn't, I wouldn't have braided rugs at all because at least theirs were moderately affordable!",2.0,-1
This color does not go well with red brick at all. I bought this and four treads. Could not use the treads because we have brick out on our patio where I intended to use the treads.

I will try to give treads away to someone. :( Both the treads and the mat are well made and pretty if you can use the color.,5.0,-1

I like the grey color and the dots of silver it matches her room perfectly. She will be able to use the flat sheet for those hot summer days when her comfort is to heavy.

"The panels are a good value, nicely made with a heavier lining and a sheer ""outer"" curtain that the lining shines through.  The blue, however, has a sheer curtain that is closer to a green color; and, while the lining is a true blue, this causes the curtains to have a pale greenish cast to them.  I was a little disappointed as I wanted the beautiful sky blue that is pictured, and it is not what they look like.  If you don't mind the blue being ""off,"" they are a good value.

This is a great looking glider set. The only criticism I have is that it is not easy to assemble. You also need more washers than were sent with it in order to place the little covers over the bolts - otherwise the covers won't fit.

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Love the set. Not a five star because two items were faulty. The rubber stopper on the foot of one chair was missing. So it wobbles.

In assembling the glider, 2 is recommended for assembly.  Good advice.  I did manage to assemble this product myself with difficulty.

The finished product does look good; however, had I known that this much assembly was required plus a recommendation of 2 people for the final steps of assembly for the glider, I would never had purchased this product. I can't recommend it.

"I'm pretty pleased with my purchase. First the plastic Rattan looks very real. It almost has a real feeling of Rattan also. Its wound as though Rattan would be, so sometimes a ""strand"" of it blocks some of the holes for assembly. This is easily resolved just by moving it around or screwing part of an edge of it into a hole. The cushions really do repel water rater well, but I wouldn't leave them out in a heavy downpour. The glass on the table is tempered, with smoothed edges and corners and the suction cups are already attached to the table. It's made in Viet Nam and comes with pictorial instructions for assembly, all the washers and bolts you need, and an Allen wrench.  Two people (working well together) to greatly reduce assembly time. I was still able to put it all together by myself but felt like I'd just earned a Doctorate in Engineering when I was done.  It looks good.....but NOT as good as in the photo, simply because I don't have a vase of flowers and a pool for it to sit in front of. The free shipping is also great and should be factored in when considering. The chairs are not adjustable, but I'm 6'1"" and 250 lbs. and can still sit fine in one, so only the largest of people need to check out the exact measurements before buying. Hopefully, this is a purchase that will bring me many summers of use.",4.0,1

We have a smaller upstairs balcony that we wanted to add some nice seating to enjoy the cooler nights. This rattan seating seat is just what we needed. It arrives in a pretty small box and all the parts were packed together well. THe directions are really easy to follow and everything is clearly marked which makes the assembly process easy. I would recommend using a torx bit I think it was a T25 and a ratchet to make it easy. The seats go together easily and they are really comfortable. They have a rounded back and arms which makes it a lot better then your standard square style ones. They come with a nice cushion to add a bit more comfort to your seats. The table is nice and stable and comes with a nice glass top so your drinks or items have a solid platform to sit on. It's a great chair set for smaller balconies or if you are trying to set up a nice little seating area. It's been a great addition to our space and now we can enjoy the cool summer nights in style.,5.0,-1

"I have dreams of a beautiful, big wrap around porch with a huge Victorian patio set...until that exists, I have a small covered side porch that nothing seems to fit on nicely. This was an excellent pick for the space and color of my house. I know that sounds odd, but my house is in shades of blue, grey, and black, so this was a very pretty match aesthetically (ignore the chalk all over and the black paint that needs touched up. Lol)It was also a perfect size for the area. It was hard to find a set with 2 chairs and a small table to relax on while we watch the kids wreck havoc in the yard. Fits a large citronella candle, ash tray, and 2 drinks easily. And the glass itself has nice anti skid pads and divots on the rattan so it really doesn't move at all.The chairs are extremely comfortable, especially considering the size and price. I am 175 and my husband is 225 and both of us got easily and comfortably in the seats. The cushions are plenty thick enough for us, unlike some comments. The color was great and padding fine. I see no need to change them out as an average sized person.And set up was a breeze. Came in a single box with individually wrapped pieces. All undamaged and individually marked with letter stickers to make putting it together less than 45 minutes. Everything fit together easily and the whole set sat even on the concrete.

These mixers work great - especially for whipping cream!  The whisk attachment is my favorite!  It's also very quiet and easy to adjust the speeds. The only reason I gave only 4 stars is that this was a replacement for an older model of the same mixer and the new one has a sort of “stutter” start to prevent splashing (which it does) but it seems to cause it to be harder to control whipping cream. In all other aspects it works perfect - but as that was the main reason I bought  the replacement  I was surprised.,4.0,-1
"After researching hand mixers, I chose this mixer because it seemed like a decent mixer that wasn't really expensive. As other reviewers have noted, it does spray the contents of the bowl all over on low speed if the beaters aren't held out of the bowl until it slows down after its original blast of power. Once in the bowl, the mixer worked well to blend on slow speed and to whip egg whites into stiff peaks using the higher speeds. It seems quite powerful and doesn't bog down when mixing stiff things. The only complaint I have is that it is very loud. I feel like I need ear plugs when using it.",4.0,-1
"Saw this at the store a month before Thanksgiving and thought this would not only replace a very old but much loved, 12 year old deep fat fryer, but the rotisserie and steamer was/is a plus.

After all were served, had one slice of white meat left for me, with everyone claiming it was great.  All I know it was so easy to setup, use with worries about turkey fryers indoors.  Followed the instructions explicitly and the experience was great, no boil over at all.  Also have used it as a French fry session. Heat was very stable and responded well.  Thanks Cuisinart for a great design.",5.0,1

It just couldn’t whip up the egg whites. I was curious why it has only one whisk, not two...Anyway, I tried a couple more times and I gave up. It was super loud as well. I think I will have better luck with mini stand mixer then this hand mixer. Sorry. It is just not a mixer for me.",1.0,-1

My goal when I bought this mixer was a slower low speed to allow more control. That is the best feature of the mixer.

"I bought this mixer within the last year when the one I've had for 40 years died.  This new mixer is so well designed.  Everything, including the cord, is stored inside a case that attaches right to the mixer's body.  That way you have a handle to carry it with.  No more hunting around for the beaters or other attachments.  It works well too.  I love it.",5.0,-1

"I bought this item about a month ago.  I don’t bake much, so I have only used four times.  It has worked great, but I haven’t used the dough hooks yet.  I like the fact that it starts slow, so flour, etc, doen’t  get thrown out of the bowl.  Increasing the speed is easy to do, and I also like the easy beater ejection.  But, twice I had trouble getting the beaters to click in.  The first beater inserted, the’large’ beater, always goes in smoothly, but the second beater doesn’t always click in right away.  I had to eject the first beater, and start over, several times.  An easy thing to do, but I am considering contacting the mgr for a replacement.  Other than that one thing, this mixer works great.",5.0,-1

It either requires two people (one to hold the frame down) or to do it solo the mattress has to be taken off first.  The mattress is very heavy and extremely poor quality. In less than 6 months it has a huge dip in the center and is lumpy.  This futon is so low quality I don't even plan to try to sell it on Craigslist to recoup some of the cost. I will give it away to someone who is desperate to have some kind of furniture. The frame is attractive, was easy to put together, and is sturdy, just way to light to be functional. If you want a futon that is going to be used with any regularity, do yourself a favor and spend $200 more than this one. Purchasing this was a $250 mistake.  I put a zip cover over it since it was going to be slept on, thus the gray color.",2.0,-1
"I absolutely love this buffalo check table cloth!  I have a farmhouse décor theme and it goes perfectly!  This table cloth is great quality.  It is very thick and well made.  It is about 83 inches long and about 59 inches wide.  It is 100% cotton so it makes it very easy to just put in the washing machine to clean it.  This is a great tablecloth to put on to protect your table from spills and also looks very stylish at the same time.

"I love buffalo check, but I never before thought to get a tablecloth in that pattern, until now. And I am so pleasantly surprised! I really love it! I got a size that was slightly smaller than my table as I didn't want the whole table covered look. I love how just putting this tablecloth down gives my kitchen a more chic, more put together look. My husband who normally dislikes tablecloths, came downstairs and I held my breath to see what he would say and the moment he saw it, he said, “Wow! This looks really good babe!” Winning! Lol also, I have 3 kids and since we've had this we've had pasta and a lot of red sauce type dinners. Some of it did get on to the table and when it did I made sure to wipe it up quickly. I then tossed this tablecloth in the wash, dried it, and it came out looking as good as the first time I took it out of the packaging. I'm really happy with this brand!

"This chair is used just as an accent chair in our family room...obviously. A review out there states it's too small for them and appears to be a child's chair. Child's chair, NO, but the back is shorter than most chairs you're probably use to. However the height of the chair is perfect for our room because we don't have any towering furniture, so the height corresponds perfectly with everything else in our room. It MAY look too small in a larger room with tall furniture--just my opinion. I actually like that the chair comes to my mid to high back. The seat and backing are cushiony (is that a word?) and comfortable--they could be better though and that's why I gave 3 stars. The chair came with NO flaws, all holes drilled correctly, and it was easy than picking your nose to assemble. GREAT CHAIR FOR THE PRICE! HIGHLY SUGGEST.",4.0,-1

"The chair serves as an accent chair in my living room. Like other reviews mention, the back of the chair is much shorter than I would like and looks a little out of place - more like a large child's chair than for an adult. I'm a 5'4"" woman and can sit in it easily but my husband or another male (unless he is a small guy) probably wouldn't sit on this chair and be comfortable. The chair came with a few fabric strands that were loose that I had to cut off with scissors. When you sit in the chair, it's noticeable the chair's material is thin and stretchy (like jersey) and the seat of the chair is foam because it squishes down with even a light person sitting on it and then the fabric looks loose. It was cheap enough that if it wears out in a couple years so be it. This chair will definitely look out of place in a large space. It's more suitable for a small room or tight space where you need occasional seating for guests.",4.0,1

I've put it in the guest room because the colors match but it looks so silly because of its Lilliputian size.,3.0,-1

I love this tablecloth!  It feels nice and durable.  I'm so glad it is not stretchy.  It is a great size and covers my table nicely.  I love that it can be used for everyday and all occasions throughout the year.  I also really like that it is machine washable and you can put it in the dryer as well.  You can iron it too if needed.  I would definitely recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],5.0,-1

"This chair isn't as bad as others would have you believe. My only issues are the color and assembly. I was expecting a smaller chair, which is what I needed for the space. It is sturdy and not bad in terms of comfort. I purchased the lavender, but I don't see lavender at all. I was ok with this going into the purchase (after reading other reviews), as the room is lavender and light gray. The picture, however, did seem to be a faint lavender, or possibly grey with lavender flowers. Nope, not lavender by any stretch of the imagination. The other issue was the assembly. At first glance, it looks like the easiest assembly ever (4 simple steps). But you can't see what you are doing; if things aren't lined up properly, you could end up stripping the screws.",4.0,-1

Not worth it.  Bought one of DHP's 6” coil full futon mattresses first then bought this frame thinking it would work since it said it is compatible with this frame.  I tried switching from bed to sofa and it won't switch because the mattress is too heavy and rigid for the frame.  Waste of money on something that I can't fully use all its functions.   Now I'm just using it as a bed and that's all. If the coil mattresses are not for this frame it should specify. Yeah,1.0,-1

"I purchased this chair to be used in a guest bedroom. It arrived 3 days later than what was represented on the Walmart website when I ordered it. When it arrived it appeared to have no legs or attachment hardware. I contacted Walmart and they immediately sent me a replacement. The second chair also arrived with what appeared to be no legs or hardware, however, when my husband was turning the seat over he felt something under the black cloth attached on the bottom of the seat cushion. On closer inspection we saw that the black cloth was attached with velcro and not stapled. We pulled off the black cloth and wedged deep into the seat was a box containing the legs and attachment hardware. On the first chair the box was wedged so deep into the seat it could not be felt. There were no directions in the box or even a picture to tell you the legs were in the seat and concealed under the black cloth (the directions were in the box with the legs) which would have been helpful. The chair I bought is in ivory and I like the pattern and the neutral color. It is comfortable and seems sturdy, however, it is a little lower to the ground than I expected. Also, one leg seemed a little short, when placed on a hard surface. I am putting it in a carpeted bedroom and it sits squarely when placed on a carpet. I decided to keep both chairs. With the second chair, all four legs set squarely on a hard surface but my husband had a problem with one of the bolts and could only get it to screw in 3/4 of the way, however, it does not seem to affect the sturdiness of the chair.

"I purchased this online and shipping was fast. My husband assembled it, but did need 2 people to align the slacks to the frame. I should say it made it easier having 2 people. Sturdy for my 18 month old and 5yr old plays on the bed as well. I love that it has a more sophisticated look than some character beds we had seen for same price! It fits perfectly in kids room without taking up too much space. Mattress fits perfect and so far we're happy with our purchase.",5.0,-1

"I love the look of this chair (I got blue). The blue (maybe more of a pale aqua) thread runs throughout, so the whole chair looks somewhat blue with the flowers much more so. It was relatively easy to put together. I will say the chair is deep (the part you sit on), but it is short, both in height between the seat and the ground and on the part you lean your back on. I have long legs and think it sits great, maybe a tad short. I'm short in the torso, though, and the back fits me perfectly, so others may find it too short. It provides great lumbar support, though the back is very squeaky inside (nothing you can get to to try and fix). It's a fairly firm seat. Overall I'm pleased, but the dimensions to make it look a tad off from the side, but the beautiful color makes up for it.",4.0,1

I searched long and hard for a accent chair that would match the décor in my bedroom and was so happy to find this. It was easy to put together even for me (I am horrible with the simplest instructions at best). The chair does sit low as other reviews have mentioned but is perfect for me (I am 5 feet 0 inches) So whereas it sits low for others I am happy that my feet touches the ground for once when I sit on a chair. It is comfortable enough and sturdy.,5.0,-1
Love the chair. When I finished getting everything bought and together my teenage daughters new room is going to look great! Did have a nervous moment when I took it out of the box to assemble and there were no legs. After a short brief phone call to the company that made it they told me to undo the bottom material of the chair where the velcro was and see if they were tucked up in there. Sure enough they were.,5.0,-1

"As with any fabric purchase online, I was concerned about the colors of the fabric on this chair and only ordered one when I needed two. I ordered a second chair today. I need not have worried about the colors not being exactly like shown online. The chair arrived on time, in excellent condition, (the chair was well packaged), and the blue and brown is the perfect color for my decor. The deco slipper style adds some color and interest to my otherwise brown and somewhat boring living room. The brown in the fabric is a medium dark brown, the blue is a light turquoise. The legs are a dark espresso. The chair is very easy to put together, took about 10 minutes. Just a very important note though- the legs are tucked inside a box in the seat of the chair. I could not locate them and thought the legs were missing. I called the help desk number listed on packing slip and was advised where to locate the legs. Excellent chair for the money. I highly recommend this chair and shopping at Hayneedle. I have purchased several items from Hayneedle and I have never been disappointed.",5.0,-1

I was so impressed withthe packagingwhen i received this cake stand.  And of course it was beautiful and has some weight to it.

"Perfect. I have an older (90 year old) house that is quite small compared to more modern houses. Furniture that fits is extremely hard to find. These are just right. We bought two of them.

"This chair is quite small and low to the ground, and the chair back is also pretty short. It's not the most comfortable thing either, but it serves its purpose as an accent chair in my front room. The ""bark"" color I chose is pretty true to what it looks like online. It's lightweight, which makes it easy to move around. The worst part of this chair was putting it together. What a PAIN!!! The instructions are minimal, at best. They mix up the legs and don't mention where to put the 12 lock-washers that are included with the parts. The holes don't line up well, and you really have to wiggle and mess with the parts to get them lined up... not to mention you practically have to cut the fabric in order to get the back legs to attach to the frame. Very frustrating! Overall, I think this chair is decent for the money, and it does make for a nice accent in my front room.",3.0,-1
"Overall, it's a beautiful chair, although alot smaller than I expected. Pros: the color and fabric are nice Cons: this is not a chair that should get alot of use like a couch--it's more of an art piece Assembly was fairly easy but I hate to assemble items and i'd gladly pay extra for the service",4.0,-1
I went crazy trying to find this chair and it was finally in stock so I ordered 2. When they came in I was so excited and couldn't wait to put it together. After I was done assembling it I was shocked to see how small they were. Definitely not what I expected. Also one of the legs on the one chair was too short so the chair was wobblie. I had to go out and buy one of those things you put under the leg to keep it steady. I ended up keeping them b/c they're fine as accent chairs. All in all they're pretty and go with my decor,3.0,-1

I have purchased many items from design toscano and by far this is my favorite. The only regret i have is that i should have bought it in the large size versus medium. My friends love it and they have take pictures of it. Its just a beauty. The frame is nice with good detail to it.,5.0,-1
"Design Toscano truly has unique items that can not be found anywhere. I have been buying from them since 1999, but sadly have noticed a dramatic change from the quality they used to be known for. Over the last ten years the once fine European reproductions and quality gifts have become page after page of redundant plastic (designer resin) knick knacks. There used to be a great selection of beautiful hand made mahogany furniture, ceramic vases, brass clocks and candelabrum, etc. Now so many of the products are silly and unsophisticated and downright degenerate. My biggest disappointment is that recently the items I have purchased have arrived defective or damaged. An oil painting reproduction that I waited a month for arrived with green marker or paint splattered all over. My brother recently purchased a lamp that was broken on the base and the shade was cracked. I can understand a mistake, but when their invoices state that all products are 'thoroughly inspected' before they are shipped, one begins to wonder how much care is really taken. I commend Design Toscano on their customer service because it is truly remarkable. They always replace anything that I am not satisfied with, and are always helpful and courteous. I took the time to write this comment because I long for the Design Toscano of years past and want you to know that I will remain a loyal customer, hoping for better days. Thank you.",4.0,-1

"It took EIGHT months to receive this table after I ordered it. When it eventually showed up the box rattled with the screws and washers being loose inside.

"I have been looking for a chess table for some time. The options I saw were all very cheap or very expensive. This was a mid-range table and it is good for the price. The pros: the table is solid and well styled. It looks good in a living room. The styling of the legs is particularly elegant. The cons: one little design flaw is that the dark brown squares are the exact same color as the dark color of the tabletop-- the piece would look a little richer if there were a boarder around the table to separate the dark edge squares of the chess board from the table top. The other con is that the drawer bottom is really flimsy thin wood and the plastic drawer stop is visible beneath the front of the drawer. The manufacturer seems to have cheaped out a bit on the drawer. I reinforced mine by adding another piece of wood under the drawer. Also, the table is made in China and quality control on my table was spotty. It had a few screw holes barely visible on the inside of the drawer frame where someone had tried, and failed, three times to attach the drawer stop. I had to get one of those stain colored markers to fix the spots where the raw wood was exposed. Not a huge deal but not something one should have to do. I was offered an exchange but was told that due to back orders I would not get the replacement table for three months so I declined. One last important comment: the board is positioned on the table so that the players sit on the sides of the table with the drawer in front. That makes perfect sense if you position this between two chairs. Many of the fancier tables are set up so that the drawer is in front of one player when you are playing. That would not really work in my living room and is one of the biggest reasons I bought this table. Overall, it's a good purchase given the price.",3.0,1

"I bought 10 packs of the 95"" curtains in white after reading many reviews. Most of what I had seen had to do with colors, so I didn't worry about the white. They came in quickly, and I opened the first two packages and hung them. After stepping back I noticed two things - None of the 4 panels were the same length (and I mean 1-3"" variance on every one), and none of them were 95"" long. I already had 95"" designer curtains up, so I knew they were accurate. These curtains were hanging behind to provide just a little privacy during the day when the big curtains were open.  If the bottom of the curtains were hidden, I wouldn't worry as much, but mine are not going to be hidden behind furniture. Very disappointed in the quality. Also, there was no packing slip included in the package, and none of the packages were barcoded, much less have the brand name on them. They all came in clear packages that said 2x95 and that was it. We'll see how trying to return these goes.",1.0,1

Very disappointed as the bottom hem is only 1/2 inch which is cheap looking for curtains that will be about 20 inches from the floor.  So now I have to re-hem the bottom and re-make the top.

Ordered this chair for 19 month old daughter and she and her older sister (3yrs+) fit it well and my youngest likes sitting on it. It came pre-assembled and is a solid chair. It is clear that it will last a long time. We ordered white finish and definitely a bright white finish. It does not have any screw holes but a few staple holes near armrests and rocking base. My only complaint is the seat portion. There are visible staple holes and a slight imperfection in the paint. I do not understand why the staples could not be filled before painting since it would have made this chair perfect. Also between the slats seem a little rough and I worry bare legs might get a slight scratch. I am tempted to return for the seat flaw but the rest of the chair is great. So I may just put a cushion to hide it.,4.0,1

"I bought this for our 1 year old daughter because she loves to rock and she loves to read. It is a very sturdy chair and I was happy I didn't have to put it together. It arrived in a timely manner.I was disappointed that the staple holes were not filled and that there are some rough edges on the rungs. It is smooth where she sits and holds on, so thankful for that. Just disappointed that it isn't as professionally finished as I expected. [*] But this was made in the USA. Come on guys!For the price I expected more.",2.0,1
"I was surprised to see splinters are the arm rests of the rocker where the wood had been cut to fit into the chair back. I was also surprised to see rough areas surrounding the staples holding the slats of the seat onto the base, and no wood putty filling in the holes. I had to sand the splinters, and use some stain to color these areas, fill the staple dents with wood putty, and then sand and stain. The rocking chair seems sturdy and well constructed, except for the sloppiness in the finishing touches. But these were not trivial. Who wants a toddler to get a splinter in his finger from his new rocking chair?",2.0,-1
"My husband and I were rather disappointed upon opening the box that contained the gift for our granddaughter's first birthday. There was no packing material in the box to keep the rocker from shifting. While there was paper protection on most of the pressure points of the chair, the ends of the rocker pieces were not covered and paint was worn off of two of the four ends. The slats of the seat were stapled to the frame and then painted. Each staple was clearly visible, giving the chair a very cheap appearance. Since time was short, returning the product for something else was not an option. Fortunately, my husband is pretty handy and he was able to fill the staple holes with wood filler and re-paint the chair. It's still not great, but better than it was. Thanks for the opportunity to provide feedback. I wish it was better news.",1.0,-1

"THIS ROCKING CHAIR IS BUILT VERY STURDY AND ERGONOMIC. IT'S THE PERFECT SIZE FOR A CHILD 6 YEARS OR YOUNGER.

However, the one I received couldn't have been called ""finished"" by any stretch of the imagination. The first time I touched it I got ""stabbed"" by a splinter of wood sticking straight up from an unfilled nail-hole. I spent hours sanding, filling, priming and painting the chair. The result is really great, but what took me hours and hours could probably have been achieved by another 10 minutes at the point of production.

Shipping was fast via FedEx and packaging wasn't damaged and how many times can you say that! Only one star for now because of the big gap where the table drops. I only received 2 chairs.

I've tried these types of hoses several times throughout the years to see if they get made better. But obviously they're not every time I purchase these type of hoses they always have hoes in the holse itself.

So while you're working with it you're getting soaking wet other than that it's a great hose but they always seem to have damage around the neck of the hose not sure why I will be returning it and buying another one and trying it again this is like the third and fourth time I get this type of hose and they don't last or they come damage,2.0,1

Don't waste your money.  I was excited when I received this hose because it was exactly what I needed.  The excitement lasted a week.  It have a hole already.  Waste of time and money.

It was for a week...much to my dismay it exploded while I was watering the plant on a outside dining patio....well....lost money that day.   The hose is a waste of money do not buy it.",1.0,-1
"Very disappointed, the hose had two holes in it before it even before it stretched all the way out.    The outer cover had little snags where the holes were, I don't have anything that it could have snagged on or animals that were present, I just took it out of the box and plastic bag on the kitchen table, took it outside, laid it on the lawn, screwed it to the faucet and turned on the water.  Maybe it had been returned previously, the box wasn't in pristine condition, although in all fairness that could have been from being mailed, maybe it was just defective.  On the bright side, it did not leak at the connections, its very light weight and coils right up after use.  The return was easy,  BE SURE TO SAVE ALL THE PACKAGING, EVEN THE MAILING ENVELOPE!  I will look for something with a more durable outer cover if I decide to get another.",1.0,-1
"I received this item in the wrong color - bad way to start off.  Nozzle is made of very cheap plastic and the connections tend to be leaky (I counter this with the use of a little Teflon plumbers tape at all connection points).  On the upside, for slightly less than $10 you get an expandable hose thats very light and easy to use.  Its not a durable item but at the price, will do exactly what its designed to do.  Treat it gingerly and dont overstretch it and it should be good for a while, but these cheap China-made expandable hoses certainly dont last forever.",4.0,-1
"I connected 2 hoses together because one hose only goes to about 15 feet.  Aside from that, after 6 uses, both hoses sprang tiny holes in the length of the hoses and they are useless.  I am returning them.  Also, the sprayer units are junk.  I knew that the price was too good to be true.  This is a terrible product.  DO NOT BUY IT",1.0,-1
"I wanted to keep part of it in place and stretch part of it during use, but the size across its entirety changes during use so I couldn't use it exactly as intended.

Wow! This rug is beautiful. I love that the back is sheepskin it helps with keeping the rug from bending. The color is so bright and the fur is so soft and plush. This was the perfect addition to my little girls room. It's big enough for her to play on but not to big that it takes over the room. It seems like it is made of good quality though I would not recommend washing it if it does get anything on it but I'm sure it would be good for a spot clean. Overall I love this rug and the heart shape design is perfect for little girls.,5.0,-1

So what do you expect in a rug?? Its not thick. It feels fluffy and soft. This is definitely not a rug for high traffic or with small children because I would want to keep that new fluffy feeling as long as possible. You can also use this to dress up other furniture or as a background for a photo or something like that. I love that this item arrived vaccume sealed. I fold it inward the way it was sent to me when its not in use. Definitely a good buy.,4.0,-1

"Good for a kid. Not for an adult. Not because of quality, the quality is actually quite good. The under liner is thick and durable and the stitching goes all the way around the edge. It's fluffy but not too long on the fake fur and not real easy to pull out. Really it's because of the sized that I recommend for kids or strictly for an accent piece. Overall it's good for a kid's room, one without animals as an accent rug but not for any serious aggressive use.",4.0,-1

"This item is great and well worth the price. If you don't follow the instructions, it will leak though. There is a rubber washer that you need to put inside the female end that attaches to your hose bib. The people saying it didn't fit and that it was leaking right away probably didn't do this. I wasn't paying attention when I got mine. I had my hands fill with my son. The ""o-ring"" was left in the bag and I quickly learned that I needed it in there. Also, make sure you don't let pressure build up for long periods of time. It is thin, and I'd assume will blow out if pressurized.",4.0,-1
"The hose can not attached to another length of hose. I bought 2 - 50 ft hoses so that in case it sprung a leak I would only lose 1/2 the hose. Both ends of the hose are female. So , they don't attached to each other. The end piece snaps into the spray nozzle  and leaks horribly. They say there is a shut off, but I didn't see any. It comes with a snap in end piece so that you can screw it onto your water spigot and it leaks. The actually plastic hose inside the fabric is very narrow. DON'T NOT BUY THIS HOSE UNLESS YOU DON'T MIND GETTING SOAKING WET WHILE USING IT AND YOU DON'T MIND THROWING AWAY YOUR MONEY!!!!",1.0,-1

I figured this product might be cheap in quality because of the cheap cost. So far so good. Used it a couple times. I like that it is light and stores away easily for such a long hose. I really like it. Hopefully I won't have any problems. I hear not to leave out in the Hot elelements or the hoses like this style tend to burst. Also do not leave pressure on for long extended periods of time or they might break.,5.0,-1
"It works well but it leaks a little where the hose and nozzle connect.. for me it is no big deal.
I bought it to wash my dog outside at my townhome since we have no outside connection. I hooked it up to my kitchen sink and put it out the back door. Easy to put away inside, I use a milk crate.

I have already told people to buy it :)",4.0,-1
"Followed all instructions, connected properly, turned off pressure when not in use etc. and hose started leaking after seven days and the first leak got larger and  more leaks appeared.  I ordered two, one for right now and the other for another area which I didn't get to use yet because the leaks were so bad I had to use second which will probably fail also. Also connections leak, just slightly, but quality is so poor that I didn't dare to tighten too much. Junk, waste of $40, do not buy.",1.0,-1
"My water hose has a leak from the get-go. It leaks at the end of the hose (the end you hold). The leak at the assembly at the male end of the hose (the part you hold).  The female end seems fine.  I paid $20 (no S&H). I don't know the return policy and won't bother returning this item.   I had another similar  water hose I paid $30 (plus S&H). It lasted one year: developed a leak at the faucet connection. I think the first water hose I bought was better made.
   It depends on what you need a hose for and how much you want to spend. You may be lucky and get a water hose that doesn't leak!  
  I saw a $100 water hose at Walmart.com that was also 100 feet long. If you want a durable expanding water hose this might be the way you want to go.",2.0,-1

"""The FiberBuilt Umbrella is made right here in the U.S.A. and it certainly shows nothing but great workmanship from top to bottom. We are very impressed with the quality of the materials used to create this umbrella. It looks beautiful on our patio and it's nice to know that light to medium winds and breezes won't destroy it as might be the case with lesser priced umbrellas. As the saying goes; ""You get what you pay for!"" This product is well worth the money and we are hoping that it will last a lifetime.""",5.0,1

Not too heavy and very comfortable, and substantial enough to provide some warmth.",5.0,-1
When I received the package in the mail I was a little skeptical that a blanket would fit in such a small package. The blanket comes vacuum sealed! I took it out of package and was incredibly soft.

"As a Walmart sparks reviewer I chose to review this Flannel Fleece Throw Blanket Microfiber Plush Warm Fuzzy Lightweight Blanket for Bed because I have a love of blankets and always love trying new ones. This blanket did not disappoint! I love the softness and feel of this blanket... it's lightweight, but still keeps me warm. I chose the olive green and the color is Beautiful and exactly as described. The entire blanket is surrounded by a, just as soft, trim that is the same color as the blanket. This blanket, although listed as made for a twin size bed, could very easily be used for a beautiful accent for your couch. Perfect for snuggling while watching tv.

I would recommend this to anyone for themselves or as a gift even.",5.0,-1

It's so soft and smooth. It's perfect for a chilly night to curl up and read a good book in. I will be adding more to my house for guests and to be in arms reach on the sofa.,5.0,-1
"Flannel Fleece Throw Blanket Microfiber Plush Warm Fuzzy Lightweight Blanket for Bed Twin Gray was selected via the Wal Mart Spark Reviewer Program in exchange for my honest opinion. I really love how soft this blanket is. I use this as an around the house blanket. Also, love the color and it is perfect for someone with kids because they always seem to waste something. When this item arrived, based on the packaging, I just knew this blanket was extremely little because of how great the packing was. They made this look so little. Highly recommend following the washing instructions and you should most definitely wash it before using it. Machine wash on a gentle cycle with cold water. Tumble dry at very low temperature. It is recommended to use machine washing bags when mixing with other clothes. Even after a good wash, this blanket was still soft and extremely comfortable. I absolutely love it and definitely recommend it.",4.0,-1

This blanket will be your new favorite. It is super soft and plush. I received the twin which measured true to size. The threading along the edge is even and thread free.

I have not washed it yet so I can not say how it holds up but my guess is it will do fine with a machine was and air dry. I can say it's puppy approved.

"The Stand Steady FlexPro Hero Two Level Standing Desk came well packaged with minor assembly required.Four screws attach the keyboard tray. Set it on your existing desk or table, release the safety latch on each side and lift with two fingers. Release the latch at any height to lock it in there. The pneumatic piston raises and holds the desk in place effortlessly. The latches on the side assure it stays raised even if you lean your full weight on it. The rubber feet keep the desk in place on any surface, I had to lift it to move it back an inch as it doesn't slide. The 37' wide desk is plenty big for two 24' monitors. The grommet allows for easy addition of a monitor arm if you need 3 monitors. The matte finish is tough but could resist smudges better. The ""media"" slot in front is aimed at tablets or cell phones with no protective cover as it is just 3/8' deep. Good product and not much to break besides the piston, and honestly, how many times will you adjust this once at the correct height? A good purchase and also works well on a kitchen counter, raising online recipes to eye level.",5.0,-1

"The Stand Steady FlexPro Hero Two Level Standing Desk (Large Stand Up Desk Converter with Removable Extra Large Level for Keyboard and Mouse) came with all the necessary parts and tools. Instructions were included and easy to follow. Assembly was very simple. The only struggles I had with assembling was lining up the screws to secure the keyboard level to the top or main level. Once assembled, this desk is strong and sturdy. The desk has some weight to it but I was still able to move and lift it to the location of my choice. Once in position, I was able to easily use the desk lever to lift and lower my computer. I really like the sleek design of this desk and how easy it is to convert from a seated position to a standing one. I also like how it includes a extra large level for the keyboard and mouse. The keyboard level is stationary and does not move. To remove this level you will need to unscrew it from the top level or main level. Although it is removable, I wish that the keyboard level was either able to slide under the top or main level or become more easily detachable to tuck away when not in use. I am really enjoying the large size and the two levels. This provides a lot space for extra things like my phone, stapler, and tape dispenser. Overall, this is an amazing desk that is so versatile and made with quality and care. I would recommend the Stand Steady FlexPro Hero Two Level Standing Desk to family and friends.",5.0,-1

When I received this blanket I was disappointed in the color of it. I ordered this in gray but it looks more like a brownish pink. The border itself looks more pink. I do think the blanket is very soft and warm but if you are set on a vibrantly colored blanket I would go with another brand. It does have a bit of a glossy look which is nice. If you are using this as layer blanket under a comforter this might be the blanket for you or you could use it to cuddle on the couch with your sweetheart while watching a movie. This blanket does wash well. Its not too thick or thin. I also had no issues with peeling or anything like that. I saw it picked up only a small bit of lint even after I washed it in a load of other blankets. Over all this is a good blanket and it suits its purpose. I did receive this as part of the sparks review program and this is my honest and unbiased opinion.,4.0,-1

They must have had bad experiences with this hose before because I was immediately given my money back, no questions asked, and real quickly.... That I was satisfied with, but the hose is not worth it at all. The old saying 'you get what you pay for' certainly applies here!",1.0,1

After finally being able to fit the plastic piece on to the faucet and turned on the hose and was finally able to use the hose it then splits at the top and the plastic tubing inside broke off at the nozzle inside.

"This chair seems sturdy enough to hold heavier weights and the fabric is attractive. The cushioning is firm, a little flat and not luxe, so if you're looking for a little more of a pillowy feeling when you sit, this is not the chair for that. However, it does not hurt your butt or back either, because it has strong padding. It took about 10 minutes to put together. You need at most 2 people-- one to hold the backpad down while the other pushes in the nail. I think it's a great chair for the waiting room or office.",4.0,-1

"I had high hopes that this hose would work for me. The one I previously had used brass fittings and fit the faucet perfectly; however a dog chewed through the hose and I needed a new one. When I saw this one on sale, I thought I'd give it a try.

When I received the hose, I noticed there were 2 plastic couplings of different sizes to accommodate different size faucets. I used the larger one and it was very difficult to screw onto the faucet. Once screwed on, I turned on the faucet and the hose leaked terribly at the fitting. I thought I had not tightened it enough so I attempted to tighten the connection. At that point the plastic hose fitting split.

"Well, I messed up, but that's alright with me. This A&P Collection White Floral Leaf Twin Duvet Cover is absolutely beautiful on my twin bed. Apparently I'm not too savvy about bedding and decor as I did not realize what a duvet was. I needed a nice covering for my twin bed, saw this, loved it, and ordered it. When I received it I realized it's an actual cover that unzips to put a blanket (or duvet) inside to keep it protected. I felt silly not knowing that, but realized I can still use it as it's intended purpose. I have a quilt my grandmother made that fits perfectly inside the cover. The quilt had some fabrics used on it that are a little course and don't feel wonderful against the skin, but with the soft duvet cover it is now very comfortable to snuggle up with. There are also some places where the quilt is separating at the seams a little so this will protect it from getting rubbed and pulled, plus the cover will keep it nice and clean. I wash everything before I use it so when the cover arrived it went immediately into the washing machine and then dryer. It washed up so nicely. I'm glad I messed up, learned something new, have a covering to protect my grandma's quilt, and now have a beautiful addition to my bedroom.",5.0,1

The cover has zippers and strings to use it on a comforter and is pretty easy to get in once you get the hang of it! The duvet is machine washable which is great.

You can get a different brand called the advantage chair for the same exact price and they're already put together and it's the same type of chair. I have had many of them break already and I've had less than a year the wood is very cheap.,2.0,-1

"We love the look of the chairs, and our volunteers who were handy with drills thought screwing on the backs was pretty easy. We were missing screws for several chairs though. We also had to do a little trial and error for the ganging brackets.

Very comfortable. Only the back of the chair needs simple assembly with six Philips head screws and additional screws for the book rack if you choose to have that option. These are included with instructions. A power tool works best if you have one. The back of the chair leans back not straight. This is not a very high chair. Nice wide seat and back.

"The chairs are attractive, wide, comfortable and sturdy. However, the brackets that hold them together (side by side) are flimsy and do little to help (we zip-tied ours together for extra stability and to deter people from moving them.) Also, the screws that hold on the backs go straight into plywood, it would be better if they were bolts into threaded insert. These chairs should last a long time if left in one classroom or setting.

The price was great. Cons: Another reviewer noted that the padding is a bit hard at first. But, I really think this is a preference issue; I thought the support felt good, but might change my mind after sitting for an hour. Beware of the pattern. The picture on the internet does not show up too well. The chairs actually look slightly different in person, having some little blue dots interspersed throughout the pattern. Unknowns: Our kids are hard on chairs and I'm anxious to see how long these chairs last. They seem sturdy, but only time will tell.",4.0,1

Thought that was very good of them & supports customer retention. Received the new carton and although this one was complete with all components, one bottom plastic cosmetic piece was broken ( see photo). In all cases, cartons were delivered undamaged. Not bothering to initiate support call as this broken part not integral to stool function. Customer Service I rate as excellent. Quality control not so much.

I fell in love with this chair when I first saw it, but I should have used my head and looked at it a little more closely. I ordered this because of the reviews also. The quality of the seat is excellent, I love the feel. It has a nice large base, which makes it a very stable barstool. I was disappointed because there is absolutely no way in the world an adult can sit comfortably in this chair. No Way. The chair only accommodates my behind and about 4 or 5 inches of my thigh. The manufactured should state that this barstool is intended for children and people that have 2 foot legs!!! This would be great if it was backless. Needless to say I now have to find something that IS backless. I wouldn't waste money ordering this merchandise unless you are ordering with small children in mind. Very disappointed in this barstool and myself for not recognizing and looking at the size.",1.0,-1

"I was searching for purple bar stools that would go with my overall living room and kitchen color scheme. Couldn't find any in Canada, so had to go online. Found one at Cymax. Was definitely nervous to order online. Not sure if the color, quality would be good enough. I was really happy to see the perfect purple color, the nice comfortable seat, easy assembly and good hydraulic lift of the stools as they arrived. Price was good as well. Nothing to complain. :)",5.0,-1

These are certainly NOT JUST FOR CHURCHES AND OFFICES - a very good looking sturdy and comfortable chair to put around a big table in our finished basement for games etc. -- bought six and am very happy! No more gluing wooden chairs and pads -- these are indestructible and the padding is built in. Some people say the seat is hard - disagree completely -- it's firm in a comfortable way and the chair feels really good for sitting a long time - don't hesitate to buy.

When finished, shut the water off and hold the  sprayer open, so that the hose mostly drains, water will stop coming out of sprayer. It only takes a few seconds. When winter comes drain it well and store in garage or shed. My first one, I bought a cheap one at the dollar store. It last two years and only burst because someone left it on in between uses.

I absolutely loved the hose.  So easy to use and move around.  I would have given it a 5 star except for the fact that I ordered this June 4th and 2 days ago it exploded in the middle.  I was watering my flowers and it just popped.  I did write to the company and as yet I have not heard from them.

This is an extremely poorly made product. After finally getting it to deal without horrid leaking I discovered the gushing leak was coming from its plastic on/off valve. Upon trying to screw it on well to keep from dripping while on the whole valve switch broke. I took that switch valve out and Reconnected it directly to my outdoor spicket.  I turned water on and the sprayer went flying off within 2minutes of water filling the hose.,1.0,-1

"Bought the 25 foot version last year.  It leaked at the male end connector after 3 - 4 uses.  Followed Ohuhu's instructions to repair this (they apparently expect this to happen) which did fix the problem.  Unfortunately after another 4 - 5 uses the inner latex tube started leaking in the middle of the hose, with no way to fix it.  I followed the Ohuhu instructions very carefully for turning the hose on and off, draining it, not dragging it over rough surfaces, keeping it out of the sun, storing it correctly indoors, etc. and the thing still was so poorly constructed it was a total waste of money.  I would not recommend it to anyone.",1.0,-1

"This is about a crappy product as you can get.  I knew by the price that this might be a cheap hose, but I expected it to last more than one and half days.

these hoses look alike.  my mom bought the first one and didn't follow directions so  when holes produced in the middle she thought that was it (she left water on to the hose).  she bought another and it did the same thing and she followed directions with this one (turned water off to it).,1.0,-1

But like I said, it works fine under normal pressure. The spray nozzle seems to also work ok. If you are expecting a highly durable waterhose, I wouldn't recommend purchasing this hose.",3.0,-1

"The best part about this hose is how easy and compact it stores. It's super lightweight, so you can just loop it over your hose bib and you are done. The cons- because it's so lightweight you must be holding the hose to use it. If you want to just place it next to a shrub to let it soak in, the nozzle will spiral all over the place. Lastly, it isn't the best quality. I only got a year out of it before the connection from the hose to the bib split at the seam and burst.",3.0,-1

I like the thread count of these sheets. They are durable and wash well. The pockets are deep for mattress toppers or thick mattresses.

"I am very happy with my sheet set. They are nice and crisp, and feel very soft to lay on. I have a thick mattress with a foam topper and they still fit perfect over it.

My review for Freshee Bedding Sheet set..i first tried the sheets out. I love the quality and feel of the sheets so smooth.the quality  is great..In order to give a good review.I washed these sheets several times.I change my sheets every  two days so that gives me a better opinion of these sheets.its 90% cotton so you geat great quality  but it will last for a very  long time.I love sleeping in these sheets.I need more of these sheets  they put the sheets  I have to shame.

"I'm normally pretty picky when it comes to my sheets, but I decided to try these sheets to see if they would, in fact, keep that “fresh-out-of-the-dryer” smell with the “Intellifresh” technology they claim. We ended up using them in our RV because RV trips can get pretty challenging when it comes to intense living conditions. I must say they did stay fresh, even after a whole weekend at the beach. They also appeared to stay bright white. My only complaint would be that they are a little stiffer than I prefer. The thread count is definitely not in the luxury tier, but at this great price, I don't think you would expect the same results as a much more expensive brand. Overall, I think they're a great addition to our RV sheet rotation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",4.0,-1

"These sheets are nice, crisp white sheets – they look fantastic on a freshly made bed.  They are a great weight, cool, breathable – and do seem to maintain freshness with use – which is pretty impressive!  I've never seen that feature before in a sheet set.  The only reason I'm not giving these five stars is because they were not initially as soft as I was expecting.  I like super soft sheets and after the initial wash, they just didn't feel super smooth.  That said, with use and additional washing, I can tell that they will soften in time.  These would be ideal for anyone who prioritizes freshness, and a perfect gift for anyone with a new home, apartment, or headed off to a college dorm!

I've had these sheets for over a month now and am overall very pleased with them.  They definitely keep me cooler (not cold) at night which I really like.  They're very comfortable and have not shrunk after going through the wash several times.  The one thing I didn't like was the slight odor when you open the package.

"These sheets are crisp and fit well. They don't fall off mattress in middle of the night.  When using them, you don't sweat throughout the night and after several nights of use they were still crisp and clean. They also wash nicely! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5.0,-1
They had a weird smell to them when taken out of brand new pack so washed before using. I had hoped after washing they would soften up a bit because they were pretty stiff but didn't much.

"I generally avoid white sheet sets as a rule of thumb because, you know, they stain so easily. I never make the bed, either, so my sheets tend to get tangled and wadded up all over the place. But hey, I'm willing to give anything a go at least once so on to the bed these sheets went. ",4.0,-1

I got these sheets about a week ago. I typically have to wash my sheets twice a week however with these sheets I was able to go a whole week before having to wash them.

"I bought the green rug. The color and texture pictured is pretty spot on. It was a bit larger than I expected (which is good). I checked the specifications, but I guess I just underestimated the 2 1/2  foot diameter. The anti-skid at the bottom seems to work okay on day one.",4.0,-1

"This mat was a replacement for a similar one purchased about 10 years ago. I am not sure there was an Elite version then, but other than curling edges the two mats I had held up will for the time I had them. The new mat has much more cushion & I am hoping NO curl issues. The only thing I wonder about is cleaning it. So far I have only used a damp cloth to wipe up water spill spots. It seems that there is some color that comes off. Other than that & the slight slippage movement on my cork floor, I would have rated this mat five stars. I do really like the basketweave style in my kitchen.",4.0,-1
Bought this because I didnt want my 3 yo destroying the carpet in his room with spills and messes. I got black to cover any stains he may cause but every little piece of lint or paper or crumb shows.

I have been a huge fan of GelPro for many years and wanted to get a long mat for my kitchen.  It is beautiful and provides great comfort when I am prepping food and managing the sink area.

I bought one Gel Pro Elite Vintage Rustic Brown 30 x 108 and one 30 x 72 in Oct 2018 and would of ranked a 5 but the 30 x 72 has a place where the outside coating has come off.  There is little traffic as I am the only one in the house and I never wear my shoes in the house.  This was very disappointing for the cost of the mats.  I would of rated a 5 as they provide outstanding relief on  my stained concrete floors.  I was going to order another 30 x 108 but now am afraid on how long they will last with low traffic use.  Again they are well worth the money in regards to the relief they provide but would of expected more than one and a half months use before having issues with the quality.  Hopefully the company will stand by their product and then it would be rated a 5 plus.,2.0,-1

I've tried the sticky gel circles the company sells, and a few different types of carpet tape to no avail. The mats are well-made and do offer a lot of relief, but the sliding around is super annoying and I kind of wish I would've just kept my old, ratty GelPro mats that were around a decade old. I also hate the logo they stuck on the corner of the mat. The silver always catches my eye and it looks like some garbage dropped on the floor.",3.0,-1

The big problem we have with it - it won't stay put!  We have it on hardwood floors and it constantly slides away from the counter after doing normal tasks like cooking or dishes or food prep.  The bottom of the mat is just not tacky enough to remain in place and we are finding it needs to be moved back to its spot daily.  The reviews of GelPro GellyGrippers are not good, so I'm not going to risk spending money on a product most people say does not work.  I guess we'll have to get used to moving the mat back into place daily.  Aside from that big annoyance, the mat was a good investment.",4.0,-1

It makes me wonder about some of the other feedback I was reading about this product while I was researching it. 5 Stars because I was putting this thing through what I thought was hard work and it killed it. Overgrown hedges and trees in my yard are a common thing for me to have to deal with and gives me a chance to try new things. This bolo was by far the most effective (and fun!) method yet.

"I LOVE the look and feel of these Gel Pro ELITE mats.  HOWEVER, I have had these mats for 6 months and the pattern/color has began to crack and wear off of the top surface.  The functionality is not harmed but they are an eye sore.  We have a strict no shoe policy in the house because we have 2 kids 2 and under and we have not cleaned the mats at all.  The only explanation for the mats condition is poor quality. I am upset because I purchased TWO matching mats and considered them an investment (and I liked the warranty-- who knew that the gel would hold up just not the appearance).  Therefore, I expected them to last a couple years and they haven't even made it 6 months.

"My basketweave GelPro mat that I received as a Christmas gift began to curl around the edges.  I went online and discovered this was a flaw in that particular style and to contact GelPro for assistance.  I am happy to report that GelPro customer service worked with me VERY EASILY to get the product replaced at no charge (other than shipping to me).  When I get excellent customer service like this, I would never buy another mat from anyone else, since it is a pricey investment.  The mat was replaced by a GelPro elite style and it feels even better than my basketweave mat did.  I have RA, so it's difficult for me to stand on bare floors for any length of time.  This makes standing in the kitchen about as comfortable as it will ever be for me, and again, the absolutely EXCELLENT customer service I received from GelPro ensures I will always have faith in and purchase their products in the future, and I will always recommend their product to others.  Keep up the great work!",5.0,-1

"I purchased a GelPro Elite 30 x 72 Linen Granite Grey mat a month ago to go in front of my sink and counter space area where food is being prepared.  My 4 Norwich Terriers have a habit of licking the porcelain floor during food preparation, I supposed the food odors cause the licking.  It has created a cleaning issue with dirt sticking to that area.  The mat has solved the problem.  With the added benefit of having a nice cushy surface while cooking and cleaning up in the area.  The color looks great in my kitchen, a nice neutral grey tone that blends with my floors and stainless appliances very well.  The linen style is attractive.  Note that it is important to lay it down in the mat in the proper direction to keep it from traveling.",5.0,-1

Not only are these mats extremely comfortable but also good looking.  We bought ours with a print on them that really spices up the look of the kitchen floor.  The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that they move after standing on them for a while.  While not a big deal it is annoying given that the mats are so heavy.  They are double thick mats.,4.0,-1

"I recently bought my second set of gelpro mats for the kitchen, having purchased the first so long ago that both colors and sizes were extremely limited. One mat is still going strong, but I recently wrecked the other by dropping not one but THREE knives on it, two of which landed point-side down. It gave me the excuse to re-examine the product line and replace the black ostrich mats with the shagreen color, which looks great with my gray and white color scheme and the stainless steel appliances. I’m looking forward to another 15 years of comfortable kitchening with my new mats. Thanks so much for a great product!",5.0,-1
"We haven't had this long so can't say how it will wear long term.  We have had the classic gel pro mat for years and it had problems like the mat sliding out from underneath us literally if you moved onto it too quickly and the ends curling up, then the cover cracking, I would not buy another classic.  The beveled edges on the ELITE seem to have solved the curling issue and they have also changed the bottom so it doesn't slide.  It does walk a little over the course of the day, so once a day or two I move it back the inch or so it walks back from the edge of the floor but that isn't a big deal.  Overall, so far I love the design of the ELITE and it is WAY more comfortable and squishy than the classic, they are night and day.",5.0,-1
"I got two of these for my kitchen and love them. Makes standing at the sink and stove so much more comfortable! I got the dark gray woven pattern and it looks great—the woven pattern adds just a little bit of texture to it that I love. The only thing that isn't perfect about them, is that they show crumbs very, very easily. They look great when clean, but get dirty fast. I think a lighter color wouldn't show stuff quite as easily.",5.0,-1
"I love spending time in my kitchen, but standing was tough due to a 'bad knee'.  These 2 mats, 1 in front of sink the other in front of stove have made a world of difference.

Thanks GelPro this is a great product.",5.0,-1

Otherwise I love them.",5.0,-1
"I had two 20 X 30 regular GelPro mats.  The edges started curling up and they slid all over my kitchen floor.  I notified GelPro and E-mailed them some pictures of the mats.  GelPro went above and beyond their own warranty and gave me credit in the amount of two new GelPro Elite mats of the same size.  My mats were not the Elite series.  So I ordered a 20 X 24 and a 20 X 48.  My credits went toward them and I only had to pay the difference.  These new Elite series mats are so much nicer, really soft to stand on.  These mats stay where you put them.  They moved very little after several days of heavy traffic.  These are a huge improvement over the older mats.  I highly recommend them,  and the customer service is fantastic.",5.0,-1

I would never buy anything less than this. So comfortable. I then decided to put another set in my bathroom in front of my two-sink cabinet. I love the grass cloth texture and the color is perfect. The grasscloth is so soft. The mats are so cool and comforting on my feet. I recently bought a standing desk for my home office and I’m testing one of these mats there. I may actually buy another one to use when I stand while working in my computer. Love these mats! Easy to clean, too...no negative comments at all.",5.0,-1
"Had a Gelpro mat before I ordered this one. Last one had removable cover to wash. That was nice that you could clean it, but it was difficult to get back on. This new one has a pretty design that is cleanable with soap and water. Both kitchen mats are the most comfortable you can stand on. Their cushioning cannot be beat. However, this elite style moves a lot and has to be placed often. Maybe the next one will be the one that is the Best Ever!",4.0,-1
My wife and I are at the age that standing on a hard floor while working in the kitchen really caused our feet and legs to hurt. We purchased our first GepPro Elite about 6 months ago. I helped relieve our foot and leg pain so much that we purchased two more for Christmas. We now have 3 covering each of the main areas of our kitchen where we stand the most. This is a great product and I would recommend you purchase the GelPro Elite rather than a cheaper pad as it is well worth the money...you can't go wrong!,5.0,-1
Third one of these of the elite line. Yes they are expensive when compared to other rugs but that's because the other ones really don't compare at all when it comes to quality and performance. Once you stand on one it becomes clear.  Gel gel gel. You cannot beat the gel!,5.0,-1

As a result, I looked in to the GelPro.  I was hesitant, given the cost, but now that I have had these in my kitchen for the last several weeks, I'm a believer.  I had another ""marathon kitchen day"" after receiving the GelPro and I felt so much better the next day as compared to before.  The support these provide is incredible and they are so comfortable under my feet.  In fact, I've noticed that anyone who comes to hang out in my kitchen invariable ends up on the GelPro.

This is my second time purchasing the gelpro elite mats.  My first order was 3 years ago and you cant tell the difference in look or wear and tear between the new and the old.

"I bought these two GelPro Elite mats a few weeks ago and I love them.  They're even cushier than the last set of mats.  I have ceramic tile floors over a cement slab and I couldn't stand and cook, do dishes, etc. without them.  Wonderful mats with lots of cushioning.",5.0,-1
"I bought this a couple of weeks ago after searching for many months for a green mat at a reasonable price, and would match the green in our kitchen floor tiles . Couldn't find it, so I had to finally bite the bullet and spend twice what I feel a product of this type is worth. The mat's ""cushiness"" is superior to the one this replaced, which lasted 10 years of heavy use. I am very disappointed that the new mat does not stay in place.

I love my new Elite mat. I mainly got it to stand on while I iron or do crafts at a tall table.  It works so well that I pick it up and move it all over my kitchen while I cook or prepare meals etc.  I plan on buying more mats for kitchen.  It really helps ease the strain on my legs and back.  I'm 74 years old and wish I'd had your mats starting 50 years ago.  Very easy to clean too!!,5.0,-1
"I love GelPro mats and already have 2 in my kitchen when I ordered this one for our newly updated bathroom.

When I communicated the issue to GelPro, they offered to replace my mat - with an upgraded version! :) (I am obviously very happy with GelPro's customer service!!) The new mat has even thicker/better cushioning and a beveled edge, which should prevent future curling.

They are well worth the investment.",5.0,-1

For my new home I chose the Elite Grasscloth in Charcoal, and it is again perfect in comfort and the clean contemporary style and color for my kitchen.  The only reason I am rating it 4 stars rather than 5 is the wait time after ordering was unreasonable at well over a month until it was finally delivered.  GelPro should improve this shortcoming.",4.0,-1

I bought this product a few months ago. I have a really bad back and knees and doing dishes and cooking was difficult and done while seated. As you may image this has its own set of problems. With this gel pad I can stand and it is easier and much less problematic. It's very cushy and feels great on my feet. I can stand longer with less pain. I only wish I could have it all over my apartment. Having it while cooking or doing dishes has been a godsend.,5.0,-1
"My only complaint about this mat is its color--dark charcoal, almost black. Unfortunately, it was the ONLY remotely useful color in GelPro's extremely limited color range. I've only had it for a month, so can't comment on durability (but with one exception, which this replaced, my other GelPro mats have endured quite well the past 5 years). But I wish they would realize the world doesn't decorate in brown! Some of us like pastels, blues, greens, lavenders, rather than tan, beige, ochre, rust, deep brown, etc.",4.0,-1

"This mat is weird. It's so heavy that one has to reach down with both hands to move it. Yet, it won't stay in place. Continuously we have to put it back in place on our tile floor. Yet, it won't move when we try to move it back in place with our feet. How does it move seemingly by itself yet won't go back into place without bending over and moving with both hands. I don't recall this being a problem with our prior mats.",4.0,-1
Purchased a nice dark red color. The cushioning is wonderful and thick. The problem is it keeps moving!  As we stand in the kitchen and move about doing our tasks the pieces move    They keep sliding across our tile floors. And then they are in the wrong place. No where near the counter where I am working. Then I have to pull it back as you can’t just kick it over it has some weight to it. Which makes me wonder why it slides??

I can't say enough good things about this company and the products it sells.  They definitely stand behind their products.  Additionally, they responded quickly to our request.

The textured surface on the bottom means that it is not staying in place on my hardwood floor. My first mat did not move once I positioned it, however, this second one moves all over the floor as we walk over it. It doesn't slip, just subtly moves around with the force of folks walking on it.

This GelPro Khaki basket weave mat was a replacement for an earlier model that had edge curling problems.  The current model has a nicely tapered edge that slopes in a way the virtually guarantees that it will not curl.  We use this in a kitchen next to our primary prep area.  It is very comfortable.  Any water the drips down from our working spreads and quickly evaporates.  We are very happy with this model of GelPro,5.0,-1
"We have hardwood floors in our kitchen.  They look great,  but I (as the chef in our family) have always found the hardness of them to be pretty uncomfortable on my feet, legs, and back while cooking.  For a while I always wore clogs while cooking;  that helped,  but still left me aching.  Then about ten years ago we bought the previous generation of the GelPro Elite -- which was a tremendous improvement.  But, perhaps due to the extra stress of supporting my 210 pound frame pretty much every night,  they started to wear out,  so we upgraded a couple of months ago to the latest generation of the GelPro Elite.  WOW -- these are even more amazingly comfortable than their predecessors.  They also seem to much more heavily constructed and should last forever.  Highly recommended!!",5.0,-1

"I bought one electric lime and one tomato shagreen 20 x 36 GelPro Elite Mat, and I'd only be happier if the entire center of my kitchen were made of this substance! I parked one in front of my kitchen sink and one in front of the stove, and the difference has been exquisitely noticeable. I haven't had any back pain while washing my dishes or hovering over pots on the stovetop; whereas, before the mats I would always experience stiffness and pain during these prolonged activities (and also while chopping vegetables, rolling dough, etc.). The colors on the website were also accurate, so I'm pleased about that, too. Thanks for making such a useful product!",5.0,-1
"I bought two GelPro mats for my kitchen about a month ago to cover more area on the tiled floor of my kitchen than the smaller mat I already had.  These mats have great cushioning, but tend to shift on the floor while I'm using them.  Maybe it's the tile, but it's annoying to have to keep moving them back into place (but not as annoying as having an aching back and feet without the mats!).",4.0,-1

I have some that are a couple of years old in the same color and model that have a different, more rubberized finish on the underside and don't shift around.  The new ones just have a foam underside.  Ive gotten the same quality of Matt's at a large discount store.  Love the other ones, the new ones...not so much.",2.0,-1
"I have purchased 4 Gel mats in the past few years -- one for each area of my home where I stand a lot.  Not only are they very attractive, but they are delightfully soft on my feet and legs.  I have ordered some for friends too, and they raved about how great they are!  The mats are very easy to clean if something is spilled and withstand a lot of wear and tear, without showing any effects.  My son loves to lay on it and play with his race cars while I cook in the kitchen.  It is more comfy than the carpet!  Even better than this mat is the customer service.  The company is very responsive to emails and questions - always staying connected to their customers.  Extremely happy with GelPro!!",5.0,-1
"This is my second set of Gel Pros.  These are far superior than the first.  I have no problems at all keeping the edges down.  Maybe my first set were not Elites.  Regardless, visitors always commented on how good they felt.  This pair,  Elite Printed - Hill Country Camo Green/Black - 20x72, are beautiful and absolutely perfect!  Customer service was great.  They called to make sure I was ordering the right product before going to production with them.  I definitely recommend Gel Pro.",5.0,-1
These mats are truly professional grade and saves your back and legs on hard surface floors. I have been using them for years and the fact they are making them in beautiful patterns is a plus...had to have the teal and lime green to go with my decor!,5.0,-1
I bought 4 of these recently. Love the new no curl design. But the mats move all the time. Not when you stand on them but come back 2 secs later and they are moved. Must be sliding when you step on or off of them. Not happy with this behavior for this price,3.0,-1
I cant say enough good things about my new Gel Pro Elite pad. I thought the original was good but this Elite far surpasses it in comfort. I find myself taking my sandals or slippers off while I'm on it just so I can feel it bare footed. It makes any chore at the kitchen sink much more enjoyable. Thank you GelPro for making this product!!,5.0,-1
I waited a few weeks before writing my review to test durability and comfort. It has exceeded my expectations and is also very easy to wipe clean. My hardwood floors were killing my feet while I was washing dishes & prepping food. Now I have no complaints. It is worth every penny!,5.0,-1
"I switched to Gel pro mats after buying several cheaper ones that just didn’t feel good and didn’t last. I will never go back. It is such a pleasure on my feet and back when I have lots to cook. I have one by my stove, one by my sink and one long one at my kitchen island.  They look great, clean easily and make kitchen chores a breeze on my bones!",5.0,-1
"I am very satisfied with the quality of the mat.  If I had it to do over, I would have inquired as to whether or not the mat could have been custom made.  I would have preferred to have it 4 inches wider.  I have to move it back and forth slightly between the sink and my cooktop directly behind the sink.  A 4 inch increased width would have allowed me to use it while standing at the sink or cooktop without having to move it.",5.0,-1
"Bought this for my kitchen. Standing for as little as 20 minutes while prepping dinner had been aggravating lower back pain. The gel floor mat has helped so much. Pain isn't magically gone, but is greatly alleviated. I could truly tell the difference after one day. I've had the pad about four weeks now, and am so delighted a friend recommended this.",5.0,-1
"I now have two mats for my kitchen and I love them. They're very comfortable under my feet. I have rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis and the cushion keeps me from having to sit down and rest my feet while baking and cooking. I surprised my sister with a mat and she loved it AND she ordered another mat, also. I still love looking at the mats, they're so beautiful!",5.0,-1
"I bought this as a Father's Day gift. The support is unquestionable. However, it 'walks' all the time. I am constantly having to move it back to where we want to use it. I added an anti slip, sticky pad underneath that reduced the walking, but I am disappointed.",3.0,-1
It’s well made & provides enormous comfort. The reason for 4 stars & not 5 is because it slides on my tile floor. There is insufficient traction on the bottom to keep it from shifting. The mat is very heavy. You can’t kick it back in place with your foot. You have to manually do it.  I will test placing a rug pad underneath & hope it helps.,4.0,-1
"I bought two gel pro mats several years ago. They had become damaged at the edges.

This product is fantastic (which I already knew) -- now I love their service too! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",5.0,-1
"GelPro mats were left behind at the home we purchased.  Although, not my favorite color, we kept the mat and were very happy with it.  I recently decided I would like new replacements.  my husbsnd ordered an inferior product.  It was certainly not what I wanted.  Once I found GelPro we ordered it and have never looked back.  I have these mats in front of the kitchen sink and washer and Dryer.  I love to stand and do my laundry and sink tasks, the mats feel so good under my feet.  I highly recommend these mats.   Don’t be surprised by companies trying to copy this product.  No other companies are close to the comfort these mats offer.   And most importantly, they are so durable my dog does not play with it any longer.",5.0,-1
"This is the best Gel Pro pad I've used to date and I've been using them since 2010 or so.  The beveled edge, while a bit hard to get used to, actually keeps the mat in good condition...no rolling of the edges. The amount of cushion is extraordinary!  I love these mats and will purchase only Gel Pads in the future.",5.0,-1
"I bought 2 of these mats about a month ago.  I have one in front of my kitchen sink, and the other one in front of my stove.

I just bought a new GelPro Elite mat for our kitchen to replace our aging original GelPro mat.  I was hoping that the new mat gave the same good look and support as the old one and GelPro didn't disappoint.  The new mat has more support in my opinion and looks just as good.,5.0,-1
"I originally bought a smaller mat and enjoyed it so much I got a larger one for my kitchen.  Love it, very comfortable and stylish.  Only one problem with the mat; it seems to ""travel"" across the floor.  I must realign it's position a at least once a day.  Nothing much just a couple of inches but that can make it uncomfortable to stand .on.",4.0,-1
"We bought 2 of the GelPro Elite mats for our kitchen about a month ago and I just love them. They are lilke standing on air.  I have lower back and leg orthopedic issues and standing on kitchen tile just wears me out. Cooking a big Thanksgiving dinner and the clean up afterwards was so much easier with these mats. We've tried many other cheaper mats but these do the trick. Well worth the money, especially if you take advantage of one of GelPros sales like we did. Love the Shagreen metal gray color and texture. Looks classy.",5.0,-1
I bought two of the Elite for myself and just bought two more for my son as a housewarming gift!   There are none better than this!  The Elite are more expensive but worth every penny.  The cushioning is amazing and they do not slide.  I HIGHLY recommend this product!,5.0,-1
"I was a bit apprehensive about ordering a factory second, but it seemed perfect when it arrived. I use it in front of my kitchen sink and I love it! I would definitely order again.

"We renovated our kitchen which used to have an old wood floor. The newly renovated space features a porcelain tile floor. I am an avid cook and standing on the new tile floor was not kind to my legs and back. The gel pro mat solved the problem easily. The 72"" length easily covers the prime area where I cook and best of all it blends beautifully with the tile floor. It looks like an intentional element and not an afterthought.",5.0,-1
"We've been fans of GelPro for years and upgraded to the Elite series. Excellent product, great for working in the kitchen. We have a long one in front of the stove and a small one at our island. Only downside is they do move a bit and I have to reposition them from time to time.",4.0,-1
This is my 2nd gel pro mat.I bought the 1st one about a year ago and I have had any hip or back stress after standing on my feet from cooking.

I received my mat in December after Thanksgiving dinner prep put my down for 24 hours because of aching feet. They have saved me a lot of aches and pains since. I credited my gel pro mats with saving Christmas - I was energized and pain free even after cooking all day. I can't recommend these enough.,5.0,-1
"I purchased my mat a couple of weeks ago. I now have four Gel Pro mats in my home. They are perfect for kitchens and bathrooms! I love to cook and bake, but my feet wouldn't take standing all day on hard kitchen flooring. Gel Pro makes all the difference. I highly recommend these mats!",5.0,-1
I've been using my GelPro mats for a few weeks now and I LOVE them!! They are so comfortable and making standing for long periods of time at the counter much more bareable - no more lower back pain.

"I bought one of these at Bed Bath & Beyond for our new home. I actually thought there would be a good chance I’d return it since it was more costly than what I thought a floor mat should be. I took it home, and my husband fell in love immediately! I had also purchased some bath mats to try out, and see how they looked. I wasn’t very fond of them, so I moved our new gel pro into our bathroom. I fell in love there too! So I took the mat back to bed bath and beyond, and bought 4 online directly from gel pro because they offered a better deal. We love them!!! They are sleek and clean looking, while matching our modern home. Definitely would recommend!",5.0,-1
"We replaced a five year old standard GelPro which had started to badly curl along the edges - sort of like the rim crust on a good apple pie. The GelPro Elite is about 20% thicker the standard and feels better underfoot.

"The GelPro Elite mats make more difference than I could ever have imagined.  I am over 70 and have NO cushioning left on the bottom of my feet.  I love to cook big family  dinners, but after a few hours on my feet, they would burn and ache so much I couldn't sleep at night.  I thought I might have to give up the long cooking sessions.  But with these mats, I can stand on my feet for hours and they don't even hurt.",5.0,-1
"We had a one-off quality issue with a previous mat and received full value towards a replacement.

"This is my third gel pro purchase, and I have always been satisfied with the look and quality of the mats.  My most recent purchase is very comfortable! I took one star off my rating because this new mat seems to “travel” on my floor slightly.....even though it is quite heavy.  I do recommend gel pro!",4.0,-1

I got this mat because the first one has curled up on its edges.  They no longer make the original mat in size and color so I got this one.  I am still sad about the first mat not being usable and no way to fix the issue. The replacement mat is too large for the spot.,4.0,-1
I got this mat for a Christmas present from the hubby at the recommendation of our daughter who has owned GelPro mats for years. I have been wanting one ever since I crushed my hip in 2017. I cannot say enough about how comfortable it is to stand on this mat for any length of time and not feel the pain as bad in my hip and leg. I should have listened to my daughter and got one years ago. I would have saved myself a lot of discomfort over the years.,5.0,-1
"Because I live in Canada I had this product delivered to my son's US address, picking them up at Christmas. So, I've only had the mats in use for a few days, BUT so far, so good. It would be great if the mats were a little wider, maybe by 8 or 10 inches.",4.0,-1
I bought this large Gelpro mat as a gift for my husband. We both love the way it feels supporting our feet!! The quality and color are wonderful. We placed the mat in our kitchen on top of our porcelain tile. We are surprised by how much this heavy mat moves a round. We typically reset its position 1-3 times a day. Otherwise it's great!!,4.0,-1
This is an excellent product. It does wonders for easing back strain and fatigue while standing on a tile kitchen floor. The added thickness makes it even more effective than an older gelpro mat that we still have and use. I highly recommend this product.,5.0,-1

We just had our home remodeled and added ceramic tile to every room including the kitchen.  Since we spend a significant amount of time cooking the floor was beating us up.

I recently purchased my second set of GelPro Professional mats for my kitchen since I've absolutely wore out my first set. I use them in my kitchen as I'm always baking. Since we live in Florida our floors are tile on concrete and not good for the back or legs. I can stand on these mats all day and never have fatigue or sore legs/back.  I wouldn't buy any other materials but these and I love the wide range of colors and sizes you can order. I wish my whole kitchen floor was covered with this mats.  I'd give them 10 stars if I could.,5.0,-1
"The color was not as warm a grey as I was looking for, but the real reason for the two-star rating is that my previous Gel Pros have been the classic, slimmer mats.  The height difference on those is unnoticeable as you step on and off.  Now they only offer these tall mats and the height is just too much.  I'll need to look at other brands.",2.0,-1
"I bought 2 of these floor mats - 2-for-1 special.  Gave one to my senior Mom who cooks often and finds herself in discomfort from standing.  No more my friend!  I live in a 1st floor condo that has a poured concrete foundation and my back and feet are always in pain.  After using the GelPro Elite, I wish all of our tiled kitchen floor felt this good.  You won't regret this.  If you're not in a galley kitchen like my Mom and I, then you may opt for a slightly larger one.  These, however, work perfect for both of us!",5.0,-1
We had two Gel Pro Classics for years but they curled terribly at the edges. We replaced with the Elite. We read they don't curl.  We are thrilled with them. They are even more comfortable than the classic. The color is perfect. The edges are weighted so we don't think they will curl. We love them.,5.0,-1
This is our second time purchasing products from GelPro and they never disappoint. We moved to our new home and bought new mats and I firmly believe they will last for years. These back saving beautiful mats endure and we don't believe the other brands of these types of mats are comparable.,5.0,-1

"We love the comfortable mat. Standing on it is great, however, it moves over the course of the time it takes me to prepare, cook and clean. It just inches its way from where it's supposed to be. It's really comfortable and I love standing on it, just bummed it moves around.",4.0,-1
I replaced two gel pro mats that I had enjoyed for many years. These offer more cushion and comfort than the ones I had BUT it drives me crazy that the backing on these causes them to slip and slide everywhere. I’m constantly having to adjust them. I put a thin carpet mat underneath which makes a bit better but still didn’t completely solve the problem. If it weren’t for that issue I’d be giving these 5 stars.,3.0,-1
"I have purchased and used GelPro mats for years, but nine months ago I had to have serious foot surgery. During the three month recovery and rehabilitation, I found myself standing at the kitchen sink gently raising myself up on my toes a little at a time.

"Received Gel Pro mats several years ago as a Christmas gift from my husband.  As time went by the outside edges started to roll up causing me to catch the edge with my shoe.  When I contacted the company in January 2017, they told me the mats were no longer under warranty but requested I submit photos to identify the problem.  We sent the photos and was very pleased to learn the mats would be replaced at no charge.  Thank you so much.  I spend numerous hours in my kitchen and the mats really do help with lower back pain.

I have purchased these before through another store and love the quality but was a little worried about ordering direct from the company in case I didn’t like the color.

I got a replacement for my rugs that curled and have not been thrilled with my new purchase.  The old surface hid a lot of dirt and the rugs did not slide all over the floor.  My new rug has a great surface for my feet but it slides all over and shows every drip.  The color between the two styles is very different also and I wish I got samples of the new style as the colors are very different even though they have the same name.,2.0,-1

I ordered 3 tomato red GelPro Elite in different sizes on Dec 3rd 2018. All 3 of them move all around the kitchen floors a lot.  I bought the gellygrippers and they only stick to the wood floor. They do not stick bottom of the mats because of their texture. So mats slide right off the grippers and still move all about the floor. I'm not sure how to get them to stick. I make sure both surfaces are completely clean and dry before applying the gellygrippers.,2.0,-1
While on vacation the home I stayed in had the most amazing floor mat in front of the sink. Every time I stepped on it I could not believe how comfortable it was.

"I will admit- when I ordered these, I was super confused. Are they flannel or jersey? You can't have both!?
So the sheets arrived, and I instantly thought, 'these are so soft!' They felt like a cozy t-shirt, and I was excited to use them. They washed well, and dried easily- about 15 minutes in the dryer on high.
Once I put them on the bed, I realized that while they are as soft as a tshirt, the weave and fabric quality is stronger than a t-shirt. If it were like a tshirt, you'd have pulls and stretches all over it, but the stronger weave makes it possible to sleep and stretch out the sheets without damaging the sheets- which I'd expect you might if you were rolling around on t-shirt material! But the flannel in the fabric is soft and cozy and comfortable. Oddly enough, it feels like a good ""year round"" flannel. It's not quite as fuzzy or plushy as my other flannel sheets, so its still warm for fall right now, but I can't see it getting too hot or uncomfortable if I wanted to use it in summer time. Great purchase!",5.0,-1

"The sheets are nice and soft and look nice, but they do not fit a 17"" mattress as advertised. Our mattress is about 16.5"" and the fitted sheet is way too small. I don't think they would fit anything larger than maybe 15"". We bought sheet straps to attach to the corners and it barely keeps them on. If it weren't for that, I'd give them a higher rating, but we can barely use the fitted sheet and it will probably wear out quickly from the elastic being maxed out and the clamps from the sheet straps pulling at it. Also, I was sent the wrong color when I ordered. But customer service was quick and it was easy to get a return shipping label and they sent the correct color without any hassle.",2.0,-1

"I finally decided to take the plunge and get a real solution to cushion my feet while standing for long periods in the kitchen. Walking on the GelPro is certainly a phenomenal alternative to my previous floor coverings, and it's a remarkably well made luxury for my food prep hours and a true pleasure to stand on. However, one problem with these mats is that they slip constantly. I have a pretty good quality linoleum kitchen floor, and despite the claim that these GelPro products don't slip, in fact, they do. And constantly. I tried anchoring them using some undercarpet non-slip cushioning, and it STILL slips. Every two days or so, I have to lift up the GelPro and pull it back from where it has moved and reposition it to where it's supposed to be. If it weren't for the migration, I'd easily rate this a five, but until I find a solution, it's a four.",4.0,-1

"I ordered a factory-second ""Black Quill"" 20x48 GelPro Elite, and it came packaged very intelligently and safely. It emerged from its packaging with no wrinkles, folds, or bends. I read the care instructions, then I wiped the mat... some black finish came off of it, probably a safety coating of some sort, as it resembled shoe polish on the paper towel I used. However, there was no difference in the appearance of the mat after I wiped it off, so probably just a finishing/protective coat. At no time did I experience any tracking of this coating, even though I'd walked on it a few times before I wiped it down. I really can't even say why this one is a factory second, because I can't see any obvious flaw. How nice! I'd easily give this product a Five Star rating, except that I would need to see how it wears; therefore I can't talk about the product durability. I do use my kitchen a LOT, so I'm hoping I'll get average or better than average life span out of it. I'm very happy with this mat. It's a bit taller than I'd imagined, so the first day or two I was a bit stumble-footed, but I've adjusted and it feels great. Kudos to GelPro!",4.0,-1

I picked up 2 GelPro Elite mats about a month ago and we are completely satisfied with this purchase.  I am actually looking at buying 2 more for our lake house.

These rugs are positively heaven to stand on....it absolutely makes a difference  on my back and legs rather than standing on a hard floor.  And I was able to recycle my old one......I gave it to a friend to use in her garage since her husband's hobby is tinkering on old cars.  He loves standing on it rather than the  concrete floor.",5.0,-1

"I bought two of the GelPro Elite mats about a month ago.  I got the 30x72 and 20x36 sizes for my kitchen.  I do a lot of baking as a hobby, but I have severe back issues and a foot that was operated on, and standing for even short amount of times is painful for my back and foot. These mats have become a life saver for me. I can stand on them while baking and my back and foot do not become painful.  I noticed a big difference right away. To say I am very pleased with these mats would be an understatement. They arrived faster than I thought they would, and in excellent condition.  For others that get these, do not panic when you first lay them out and see all the wrinkles and/or creases in the mats.  I was a little concerned at first, but after about 24 hours, all wrinkles and creases relaxed and went away.  These mats are worth every penny I paid for them!",5.0,-1
"I had one of your mats for about 8 years when the edges started to curl up and it became a ""tripping"" hazard for my elderly husband. I'm not faulting the mat because we got very good use from it, but when I wanted to replace it I checked to see if you had any other design that might not have the same issue & I found the thicker elite model & have been extremely happy with it. This model is heavier too so it doesn't move on my hardwood floor like the other one did. I returned to your company because I've looked at other mats in the past & while the others may be less expensive, they can't compare to the quality of your mats. I have one more of your mats & when the time comes, I will no doubt replace it with another Gel Pro.",5.0,-1

"I was looking for some soft sheets to replace an old pair of sheets. My favorite type of sheets are jersey, so I was excited to find the flannelÂ jersey sheets. They were priced really well and I thought I would give them a try. I was not disappointedÂ when they arrived, they feel like a comfy t-shirt!",5.0,-1
I bought this to replace another gelpro.  I love the color (sedona) and the design.  It really adds color to the kitchen.  The only problem that I have with it is that my kitchen has a wood floor and the mat constantly moves on the floor.  The other one never did but for some reason this one does.  Otherwise this is one is fine,4.0,-1

"These are very attractive sheets and give my bed a luxurious look. I've used them for a week now and they feel great during this hot summer. They're light and trap just the right amount of warmth. Two layers might be better for winter, but I can't recommend them high enough for summer. Very comfortable overall and I'm happy I got them.",5.0,-1
"I will admit- when I ordered these, I was super confused. Are they flannel or jersey? You can't have both!?
So the sheets arrived, and I instantly thought, 'these are so soft!' They felt like a cozy t-shirt, and I was excited to use them. They washed well, and dried easily- about 15 minutes in the dryer on high.
Once I put them on the bed, I realized that while they are as soft as a tshirt, the weave and fabric quality is stronger than a t-shirt. If it were like a tshirt, you'd have pulls and stretches all over it, but the stronger weave makes it possible to sleep and stretch out the sheets without damaging the sheets- which I'd expect you might if you were rolling around on t-shirt material! But the flannel in the fabric is soft and cozy and comfortable. Oddly enough, it feels like a good ""year round"" flannel. It's not quite as fuzzy or plushy as my other flannel sheets, so its still warm for fall right now, but I can't see it getting too hot or uncomfortable if I wanted to use it in summer time. Great purchase!",5.0,-1

"This is the first indoor grill that I've used. We've had waffle irons and sandwich presses, but this one is almost the best of both.

Let me start by saying that I LOVE that you can pull the grill plates off and drop them in the dishwasher. My main complaint with our waffle iron is that I have to go chasing remnants through the grid with a cotton swab. No such issues here.

I tried it with chicken breasts, grilled cheese, and turkey bacon. Worked like a charm and pretty quickly.

The one thing that could be a negative is that the drip tray doesn't attach at all. It just kind of nestles under the front and counts on you not to move anything too much while you're cooking. All in all, a great buy and a solid recommendation from me.",5.0,1

"PROS: we use this griller up to 4 times a day in our household as a quick and easy way of making a fast lunch/dinner that still has that ""grilled"" look and taste but without all the fuss of starting the grill outside...the grilling surface is perfect for our needs.

the unit heats up in about 2 minutes, nice and fast, and it gets REALLY hot...so much so that the food sizzles when you place it on the heated grill, so be careful! i've also sprayed some olive oil on the grills before i turn it on, to flavor the food a bit, but be careful, as the grill heats up quickly and the olive oil will start to smoke a bit...

i can put on a raw boneless, skinless chicken breast about a half inch thick, season it on both sides and let it grill for about 5 minutes without having to turn it over and the chicken comes out completely cooked, grilled on both sides and is moist and juicy when you cut into it...it's perfect for our needs!

what i love most about it is that the grills pop out easily for quick cleanup. they are not heavy and bulky and clean easily. i do use soap and water though, because you can't clean the grill's surface by removing the grills until they have cooled down, so i let it cool and then remove the grills and soak then for about 5 minutes, then they come out looking brand new.

it's not a large unit, so you can leave it on your kitchen counter without it being in the way of other appliances or cooking surfaces.

CONS: there is no ON/OFF switch. the unit must be plugged in to work and unplugged when you are finished with it, so if you have individuals in your household that are absentminded and forget to unplug it after using, this could be a problem. i wish it had an ""automatic shut off"" design that might solve this issue.

i've also noticed that i can see some of the teflon or whatever the grill is coated with to make the black surface non-stick, seem to be wearing off a little, you can kind of see a little silver color appear in those spots, but only on the raised portions of the grill surface. i do not use metal utensils on the grill, i only use the plastic spatula type tool that comes with the grill. i think thats odd to be seeing that after only about 25 uses...but it still works great.

last con is the small spatula tool they give you..it is sooo tiny and flimsy that it's almost useless, but you can always use your own spatula, so i didn't think this was too much of a drawback.

all in all, i would definitely recommend this product. i had an older george foreman grill previously, but it didn't have the removable grills for easy cleaning and i wanted to upgrade to the new george foreman with the removable cleaning surface, but the price was prohibitive...this unit was only a little smaller than the george foreman i was looking at, and it was less than half the price.....it works great for me! if you are dieting like my husband and i are, it's a great purchase to get you in and out of the kitchen quickly and with very little mess...we've lost a total of 34 pounds in the last 3 weeks using this griller and plan on giving it a lot more use!",5.0,1

"We bought this coffee maker to replace an older one we had.

However, I still had a few questions so I emailed Hamilton Beach and they quickly answered, then I had another questions and they quickly answered my email.  For some reason they did not advertise BPA free, yet many reviews commented that it was BPA free.  So I asked Hamilton Beach that question.  I was satisfied with their response (yes plastics used are BPA free).  So I made the purchased.  I've been using it now for about a month and make a fresh pot every other day.

"I usually like Hamilton Beach products, but I'm not totally happy with this one.
While it cooks the burger and chicken just the way I like it and perfect for one or two, the top around the handle builds up steam and drips on the counter table surface. Yes, the drip tray is in place, but not wide enough to avoid this.

I emailed Hamilton Beach and this is their response, ""We will be happy to assist you. We apologize for any inconvenience you have experienced. The condensation coming from the cooking unit is not a manufacturing defect. We recommend opening the lid during the cooking process to release any built up steam.""

I bought the contact grill so it would be easy to cook, no turning the meat, so why would I lift the lid to fix that problem? I use a towel underneath to avoid it. I suggested the drip tray be across the whole front to avoid this. Not happy with their response.

"I 've had this for just over a year and I'm ready to trash it. It was wonderful at first, but the grill plates have lost their non-stick feature and they are very difficult to clean.  The unit heats up quickly, cooks evenly, and does a good job draining the grease.  However the grease tray doesn't stay in place and I can't count the times it has fallen on the floor filled with grease. That can be remedied simply by placing the  unit further back on the counter.  It's possible to buy replacement grill plates,  but with shipping and handling they cost almost as much as a new unit. Don't hesitate to buy this if you want a unit that cooks well, but be prepared for the non-stick feature to not last very long.",2.0,1

The lamination is so thin (can't get wet or this thing will ripple and warp) and poorly done that I had to take a white paint pen to all the seams just so I don't look at it in complete disgust. Several pieces were badly scratched (the back panel was completely scratched up near the cord holes) which I also used the paint pen on. The handles were a gold/bronze color even though they appear to be silver in the image.. I spray painted them silver after this picture was taken. Took me about 8 hours to put together because several holes were not drilled for (all the hinges on all cabinet doors weren't predrilled for the screws that 16 missing holes just for the hinges!!) and I didn't have a drill. Another hour at least with the paint pen. After 8 hours and then seeing it together I wanted to cry bc I hated what I saw and I sure wasn't taking it apart to send it back. The paint pen and spray painting the handles made this livable but I do not recommend this purchase.",2.0,1

I would not pay more than $20 for this cabinet. It actually looks used. The edges are all scratched. The cabinet doors donât match the other wood. It is poorly made. We tried to anchor it to the wall and the screw came straight out of the back of the cabinet because the pressed wood just fell apart.,1.0,1

"The cabinet was easy to assemble and very functional for our use of it. However, the smell of the cabinet is horrible! It smells like a strong chemical used to make it.  I have left the cabinet doors open to air out, wiped it down with Pine Sol, set Baking Soda in little cups in each shelf, nothing works. I'm actually concerned and wonder if it's toxic.",1.0,-1

"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The color was nice, and most of it went together with very little problems. The gap for the microwave was big enough to hold my microwave & toaster, and there were cutouts in the back to be able to plug them both in. The only things I really didn't like were that it took two people to put the cabinet doors on, and that they were difficult to get level with the other side. Also, the ""glass"" on top seems to be more of a heavy plastic. Overall, I am pleased with this item. Would happily buy again.",4.0,-1

"This is a nice piece for the price. I ordered it in the white color. Be aware that the package will be extremely heavy when delivered and hard to move. Once I opened the package, I found all the screws and nails had fell out of bag they were in and were unsorted. I think I must have received one that someone had previously tried to put together, but gave up in frustration and returned. Unfortunately the almost 20 pieces of wood were not clearly mark as indicated in the direction and a few pieces had minor scratches (they are labeled, but just really hard to find). Once I spent about 2 hours just sorting and organizing the nails, screws, and wood, the process went smoothly. It took about another 5 hours to put together.",4.0,1
"Mats are very comfortable in the work areas. Substantially made, they hug the floor with NO slippage at all. a good purchase.",4.0,-1
Paid $200 and opened the box and all of the hardware was just thrown into the box loose so it scratched all the pieces. There were multiple pieces that were missing chunks out of them or corners were smashed from being dropped during either packaging or shipping and there was nothing in between the pieces in the box to protect them. For the price you would think there would be more quality and care and that it would at least have metal legs not plastic and actual glass doors not plastic since it does say glass doors on the label. I will not be buying another item through this company nor will I recommend them to anyone I know or talk too.,1.0,1

"The first unit we received appeared to have been dropped, smashing one end of the package before it was edged and bound for shipping. I immediately called Wayfair and they set up to send us a second unit, assuring me that the chances of us getting another damaged one was extremely slim. Upon examining the second unit I found the damage to both units was very similar. This leads me to believe the damage was actually done during manufacture. I will never buy anything that is manufactured by Hodedah Imports again. All the materials are so sub-standard that it was difficult to find enough parts from the two kits to put together one functional unit. I honestly feel that giving this product one star is far too generous.",1.0,1

"Nice cabinet that works perfectly for the narrow spot I needed it for. It isn't the sturdiest in the world, but exactly as expected for the price. It was pretty simple to put together and all the holes lined up as they should. I had to return the shelf when I first got it because the 2 large pieces were both cracked, but I believe that happened in shipping. Very easy and quick return and the replacemnt was in perfect shape. The only complaints I have about this are that I'm not a huge fan of the plastic pieces that serve as the hinges, but they aren't terrible, and I wish the magnets to keep the doors closed were a bit stronger. Still definitely worth what I paid for it, and would purchase again. Fits my needs perfectly.",5.0,-1

I dont typically leave reviews unless I'm really happy or really upset. This is upsetting. Ordered this cabinet for extra food storage. I was excited to receive it until I opened the box.

Very good for storage and holds a lot of books.  Looks nice and neat in any room.  I would not recommend it for heavy use as the hinge substitutes on the doors are plastic and may wear out.  Hinges can always be added to the doors if that happens.  Takes up very little floor space but I would secure it to the wall if in a high traffic area or children are around.,4.0,-1
"I would give this product ""0"" stars of that were possible. This is the worst prefab piece I have ever purchased. None of the holes matched up properly, and elements of this component are cardboard. The backing is particularly flimsy. Because I ventured to attempt to put this together, it is not returnable, despite the fact that it is unusable, so I guess I am out the money. This cabinet would never be able to support the weight of a microwave oven. I doubt that the cheap surfaces would survive even one cleaning. I debated putting this cabinet to the curb as trash, but instead will attempt to find a use for it. Maybe to store light linens in the attic. I will never purchase a brand online that I'm unfamiliar with again. Live and learn I guess.",1.0,1

This is the biggest piece of garbage I own. Save your money and pay an extra $50 to purchase a nice one that'll last you awhile. From the day I put this thing together it is falling apart.

"I love this chair! It is the easiest piece of furniture I've ever assembled. For those who've had the joy of assembling furniture before, all the legs are the same, so it doesn't matter which leg you start with, they all end up in the same direction. The back was very easy to put on, too. A couple of thumps, and it's in. There is a bit of space between the bottom of the back and the chair to make it easy for cleaning. It is so comfortable! I was really surprised! I was expecting it to be comfy because it was new, but the seat is firm, yet inviting. No sags or loose stuffing. This is what they say about the seat, I'm going to say it's accurate: The seat cushion has thick foam and pocket coils over a sinuous spring seat deck. The color is exactly as shown. Also, this chair is 100% polyester fabric, which was a big plus for me because it means it will be easy to clean. Note: I don't have small children, so this will be easy to clean for me.",5.0,-1

"For the price, this is a decent bookshelf.  It took me about an hour to put it together, and that was because I used a drill for about half the assembly (the main structure had to be put together using an allen wrench).  Some cons:  the magnets aren't particularly strong.  We got this to keep our young children out of the book case.  I'm not sure how well these magnets will help that, but it's better than what we had.  Also, the handles are plastic.  If using a drill to assemble, be careful not to overdrive the screws.  The tips will easily come through the plastic handles.  The shelf already had some minor scratching on it as well, and I don't think the finish is particularly durable.  But for the price, overall, this is a good buy I think.",4.0,-1

"It is really ridiculous that I ordered a Hodedah 5-shelf, 5-Door Multipurpose Cabinet from you in black and had to return it because it was broken in half. I then had to repackage and tote it to the post office to return it and then I get a replacement and it is the wrong color. You sent me a Beech colored shelf and not what was originally ordered. No one called me to tell me they were changing the color. Original order 3772039-771341, replacement order 3972077-736193. I am going to keep it only because it is too heavy to keep toting it back. I haven't opened the box yet and hope that it is not broken in two like the original one.

"The Hotel Brand 600 Thread Count 4 Piece Sheet Set is absolutely fabulous! I was quite smitten with these because I have slept on many sheets in my time, and was happy. Then...along came these. Now, I know what people mean when they say a higher thread count really does matter. I've always slept on the 300's, but never higher. However, since being given the opportunity to try these sheets out and review them honestly, here's my true opinion. #1, They wash up really well. #2 They dry wonderfully, and did not wrinkle(did not give them a chance to because right out of the dryer they went directly on my bed). #3 The Fitted Sheet has a deep pocket with a fitted seam that keeps the sheet from slipping, and makes it fit like a dream on my European pillow top mattress. #4 The material is a Sateen weave for a superior sleep experience. I love everything about these sheets, and will be purchasing another set. So glad Walmart is able to offer such wonderful products at a great price point. I highly recommend this set.",5.0,1

"These sheets have the classic satin stitch at the top for understated beauty, and they would go well with almost every style of decor for that reason. Other sheets can be limp and lifeless, and sleeping on them is not really much of an experience. That is definitely not the case with these sheets. These sheets are crisp and full of body. Just putting them on the bed makes you look forward to bedtime. I feel pampered when I get into bed and sleeping on their pearly smooth texture is dreamy - they don't bunch or pull off the mattress. They also don't crease easily so they look good even after being slept on.
The best features have to be the wide elastic all the way around the fitted sheet and the elasticized pocket seam. My mattress is only 12 inches thick, so the fitted sheet curled under about 8 inches all the way around. But it didn't bulge or cause the mattress to be bumpy - it was very neat and smooth. This is important when you have a raised metal foundation (as opposed to a box spring) because extra linen can sometimes fall through the wire mesh under the mattress and look messy.
I liked these sheets so much, I recommended them to my mom.",5.0,1

"This sheet set is made from 100% Egyptian cotton. The thread count is 600 adding some weight to a king size set. Hotel Brand incorporates ""Optifit Technology"" for a secure fit for a 9 to 20 inch deep mattress. It also has stretch corners for a smooth fitted sheet appearance. This product is made in India and the quality is very good!

The sheet set was washed and dried after before fitting them on our bed. My first impression was they felt rather ""crisp"" compared to our older sheets. They also made a noise when rubbing against each other and when you change your sleeping position through out the night. Both of these characteristics do not deture from being very comfortable.

I like these sheets very much and would not hesitate replacing our sheets we presently own with another set of Hotel Style 100% Egyptian Cotton with Sateen Weave. I certainly love the feel of these sheets and look forward to sleeping in them every evening.",5.0,1

"This review is for the Hotel Brand 600 Thread Count Sheet Set. This is the King sized sheet set and the color is cream. They are nice and soft and I do like the feel of them. I was immediately impressed with the fitted sheet which fits perfectly over my deep mattress which also has a three inch mattress topper on it. I hope you can see from the picture the long band which stretched and covered my entire mattress; the label calls it ""Optifit"" I call it the first time a fitted sheet has covered my entire mattress in a long time LOL. The gathering that makes the sheet fitted has a sewn in white band all around. Also remarkable is that the flat sheet seems longer because it hangs way over the bottom of the bed with the top being all the way at the top and the sides hang nice too. However the test will be when it is washed but it sure is nice now. OK so I took them off my bed and washed according to the label. They washed just fine so I put them in the dryer per the label and voila; they still fit the same. Yes I certainly would recommend this set.",4.0,1

"The sheets are very soft but they are too big. I could hardly get the fitted sheets to fit snugly as you can see from the picture. Also, it is difficult to tell which way to put it on the mattress. The top sheet hangs almost to the floor, and my mattress is not set low. The pillow cases are also baggy looking, and my husbands pillow is probably about 6 inches of thick foam.

The top sheet has a nice decorative thin silk line along the top. The pillow cases also have it. The fitted sheet has a wide elastic band all the way around the bottom to help keep it on the mattress. I like this feature better than the ones that only have the elastic at the corners.

The set only comes with 2 King pillow cases. We have 4 King size pillows between my husband and I, so that's always a pain to have to buy additional ones separately.

Bottom line: The sheets are very soft and cozy, and the only thing that I really do not like is how wrinkled the fitted sheet is on the mattress.",4.0,1

"These are not bad for a 600 count sheet set. The softness of the sheets is not as soft as some. But it doesn't feel bad against your skin.
The cream color is more of a yellowy cream. But it is a nice shade.
When I saw on the package that it is Hotel Brand I was intrigued. After I opened the package and examined the product I totally understand why. They remind me of a hotel sheets. They are thicker than most sheets that you can get. I think that this is a good thing as I usually have to replace sheets after they get thin where my feet are. These sheet will definitely last longer than any previous sheets I have had.
I really like the elastic around the fitted sheet. It is not the usual thin strip around it. It is 1"" wide. All the way around. It should help the sheet to stay in place better. It does make it so that you have to work to put on sheet straps if you use them. But it can be done. And they may not be necessary with how wide the elastic is. And it seems like strong elastic too.
Also on the fitted sheet it has a strip on elastic to make it so that it will fit better on the corners of your mattress. Never seen this before. It made it easier to put the fitted sheet on my bed. I have a mattress and a foam mattress to cover with the fitted sheet. It fit really well. And even had room to spare. It says it can fit a mattress up to 20"" deep. Mine is about 13"" and I had no problem.
There are 2 downsides to these sheets. Both are because of how thick the material is. One is that they are noisy. It takes some getting use to. Barely even moving makes a noise. And the other is they wrinkle really bad. Right out of the dryer and they look as if they need to be ironed. Not a fan of ironing sheets.",3.0,1

"These Hotel Brand 600 thread count sheets are very scratchy and not very soft. I was very excited to try these sheets thinking with the name Hotel Brand these would feel like expensive sheets at a fancy hotel and being such a large thread count they would be super soft, but they are not. Right out of the package they were very scratchy and did not feel soft at all. I washed them thinking they would soften up but they did not. I decided to wash them again and this time use fabric softener which I rarely use and these sheets felt exactly the same, rough. I put them on my bed and slept on them. It has been about four nights sleeping on these sheets and the longer I sleep on them the more I am getting used to them. But they still feel the same and they make warm and itchy. I do have sensitive skin every once in awhile and these sheets just do not give me a comfortable night sleep. I do like how deep the pockets are on the sheets and the elastic band on the fitted sheet is very thick and can with stand a lot of tug and pulling and washing and use. I am just disappointed in the thread count majorly. I also though the higher the thread count the softer the sheets. This is not the case with these sheets.",2.0,1

"I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder. My husband and I are used to sleeping on soft sheets, and these didn’t feel soft on our skin. It felt softer on my fingers before I washed it, but after putting it through the wash cycle once, following their directions to the letter, the sheets felt rough on my face. I thought that it would feel rough sleeping on them, but it wasn’t bad. It’s like it has mega doses of starch in it. And it makes a sound when it is moved. I think it’s a bit loud when trying to get to sleep. But comfort wise, it wasn’t uncomfortable to sleep on, and even the pillowcase against my face wasn’t noticeably abrasive. When I asked my husband what he thought of the sheets, he said, he was expecting them to be softer and replied, “They’re cool sheets that are not scratchy or soft.” Because the sheets don’t feel like those awful polyester/cotton blends, this set is a blessing. I agree that the set is beautiful. There is a sheen to them that makes me think of a pearl. That and the nice bright white color, make it an attractive sheet set. It’s mostly a plain set of sheets and that’s good, because my last set of sheets had a lot of embroidery on the top sheet, which not only made it uncomfortable to the touch, but under my rigorous washing system, it drew up in that section. There’s only a thin strip of decorative white thread at the top of the top sheet and the mouth of the pillowcases, and that is enough to give it a nice look. Plus, the sheets didn’t draw up there. But then again, it might draw up if I had put the sheets in a hotter dryer cycle, as I did my old ones. I discovered that “Egyptian cotton” doesn’t mean much. It’s not an effective guide in finding comfortable sheets. My last pair was, and it led me to think these would be as comfortable, but they’re not even in the running. Two additional features I liked about the set, is that it has a wide elastic strip around the fitted sheet and on the outside, there is this beautiful gathering of material that is very appealing. I don’t know what a seamstress calls that, but it’s a shame that it’s hidden under the mattress and top sheet. I also like how big the king size top sheet is. I chose this set because I wanted to hide the fact that, underneath, lies a tall queen size air mattress. It totally hides it. Since our king-size bed isn’t here yet, I couldn’t test how well it fit a king size mattress. However on this queen size air mattress that stands twenty-three inches high, the fitted sheet covers both sides at the middle and though it covers the top portion of three corners, it exposes their lower portions, near the floor. On the top right corner, eight and a half inches were exposed as were six inches on the bottom left corner area. As tall and thick as the fancy mattresses are, like the memory foam mattresses, I do feel that it would cover most of it, if not all. My only concern was that it wouldn’t be a good corner fit. It just didn’t seem wide enough for a king. Besides being softer, one feature that I wish it had was large print labels that said, “Top Left Corner”, “Top Right Corner”, “Bottom Left Corner”, “Bottom Right Corner”. It was hard to tell the short side from the long side, because of the elastic. In summation, I’ve only had these sheets for a week, but this model did not tempt me to own a second set.",2.0,1

With - OPTIFIT Technology fits mattresses up to 20 in. deep.

I chose the Queen size sheets in the Cream color to review. Received my Hotel Brand 600 Thread Count Sheet Set packaged inside a zippered clear plastic fitted covering. It was delivered inside of a cardboard box approximately of the same size. I just love the cream color , very rich and luxurious look and feel. The instructions direct you to wash your sheet set first before first use. Instructs to wash in warm water with like colors and NO bleach. Tumble dry low, Iron on low as needed.
Upon making bed I really like the ease of stretch and deep pockets . I have had other sheets of around the same price but definitely not of same quality and comfort that my Hotel Brand 600 Thread Count Sheet Set provide me. These sheets are of great quality and the comfort and sheen looks and feels like I have spent way much more money than I did. The smoothness and softness had me sleeping in comfort .Even though I received this Hotel Brand 600 Thread Count Sheet Set free to review, I will definitely buy them for my family and home in the near future .

"The wide elastic sewn into the crimped corners is a game changer.  I usually buy 1000 count 100% Egyptian Cotton sheets that are very dense and heavy, but they are very difficult to find now. Thought Id give these a try and they are much thinner and the thread count is not as tight, but I really like how the sheets stay in place. Drawbacks: My bed isn't made as tightly and as a result the sheet gathers under a resting body and creates areas of pressure leaving sheet marks on the skin.  Thats because its only a 600 thread count.  Sheets that aren't dense wrinkle easily when in use.",4.0,-1

"I recently received the Hotel Style 600 Thread Count Bedding Sheeting Collection from Walmart as part of their Sparkreviewer program. The product arrived in excellent condition. The set of bedding I received was queen sized and it came with both a top and flat sheet as well as 2 pillowcases. The flat sheet measures 94”x104” and the fitted sheet measures 60”x80”. The pillowcases are labeled as standard size, but I found them to be slightly larger a normal standard size. The color I received was a deep teal green color. It's not a color I would choose normally but it is an attractive color. My first impression upon unpackaging the sheets was how soft they felt, and my second impression was that they felt heavy. They also have a slight sheen to them. Unlike most of the sheet sets I have purchased in the past several years, the Hotel Style set feels very thick and substantial, not flimsy or lightweight at all. Per the manufacturers care instructions, I washed the sheets in warm water and tumbled them dry. I purposely washed the sheets by themselves so as not to crowd the washer and used a dryer sheet that helped to prevent wrinkles when drying . They came out with more wrinkles then I would have liked but they are 100% cotton, so I was not entirely surprised. Some people might feel the need to iron them but I'm not one of those people, lol. I did feel though that they also lost a little bit of their softness after washing, which I found surprising. I have a 12” pillow top mattress and these sheets fit my bed fine. If anything, the fitted sheet was a little bit big but the all-around elastic on it is thick and holds the sheet in place nicely. Because the elastic on the fitted sheet is thick and goes all around, I found it somewhat difficult to determine which was the long side and which was the short side but I noticed that the manufacturer stitched in little corner labels to help with this, although they are easy to miss. The packaging states that the sheets can fit a mattress up to 20” deep and I don't doubt that they would. The set comfortable to sleep in, not scratchy at all. These are not sheets that are going to pull if you run a rough heel over them. Because these sheets are 100% cotton, I am hopeful that after continued washings they will continue to soften, which will also help to minimize wrinkles. I am impressed with this sheet set.",4.0,-1

"I love these sheets! I actually have 2 sets of the same color grey. I love the color of these sheets, it's perfect for the fall. I'm really not sure about comparing them to hotel quality since I haven't stayed in one in a while. I will say that these sheets are good quality sheets. The elastic band is very thick and it does go over mattresses that are 20 inches deep. I LOVE that they have a tag telling which end is which. To be clear there's a tag that says top/bottom. It makes putting the fitted sheet on the bed much easier and faster. They wash well and keep the color. Sateen sheets are my favorite because they're are soft and shiny (not too shiny like satin sheets). The pillowcase fits one of my memory foam pillows that is a little longer than the standard pillow. Again, I love these sheets and I definitely recommend them.",5.0,-1

"We received this Hotel Style 600 Thread Count Queen Size Sheet Set in the color brown. This set is a very good quality sheet set. These sheets are 100 percent cotton with a sateen weave. After the first wash, the fabric had such a soft feeling to it, not stiff at all. Right out of the dryer they were not wrinkly at all, but I procrastinated and they wrinkled before I got them on. The worst part of any sheet set ie when the corners keep slipping off and you constantly have to keep making your bed by putting the sheet corners back onto your mattress. So one of the Best things about this Hotel Style sheet set is that they are called performance bed sheets because the fitted sheet has a True Grip Patented Elastic on the corners to help the sheet stay in place while giving it a snug fit. Now I no longer have to struggle with attaching those awful sheet straps!!! These sheets fit any size mattress from 9 through 20 inches. However, I'm giving these sheets a 4 out of 5 due to the bunching and bagginess around the corners. I am very impressed with these Hotel Style Sheets otherwise, and the high quality fabric for such an affordable price!

"When I opened the packaging, the first things I noticed were the good quality of fabric, the softness and the beautiful muted hue color of the sheet set.

They are 100 % cotton with Sateen Weave so they have a little shine to them which makes them look and feel amazing. I have a 4 inch mattress topper on my bed and the fitted sheet fits very snug with a thick elastic boarder around the whole bottom sheet. The stitching is very thick so they are very well made. The color is beautiful, I ordered manatee gray color , but it looks brown. Looks great and feels even better on my skin. I washed these sheets and put them in the dryer, they kept their color and shape, the only thing I would do different is hang them on the line to dry to they have less wrinkles. I think because they are so heavy and were washed for the first time, they were very wrinkled when i took them out of the dryer, but they still feel great to sleep on them.",5.0,-1

This product is 100% cotton but has a Satin touch to it and that's it is a little soft and slippery, unlike other cotton sheets. As per the care instructions, it is advised to wash the sheets in warm water and let them dry on their own. I did that to see if the color bleeds but it did not. Overall it is a nice product.",4.0,-1
"I picked these sheets for the guest bedroom. they are as described, hotel quality look and feel. They are thick and not see-through at all like some cheaper sheets are. I love the rich blue-green color and they have a nice Sheen to them. I have not had the opportunity to wash them yet so I don't know if they will need to be ironed after washing. I will likely treat them as regular sheets and wash them, and then throw them in the dryer alone without any other clothing for 5 minutes then take them out and hang them to dry so I don't have to iron them at all. They have a nice edge on the top sheet has a nice finish at the head of the bed period my favorite thing about these sheets is that the fitted sheet comes with elastic that runs the full perimeter of the sheet. The fitted sheet also has very deep pockets so you can use this with or without a mattress topper. The strength, flexibility, and thickness of the elastic that runs the full perimeter is high quality and allows you to get a nice flat finish when you put the top sheet on without struggling to align the corners. Excellent quality.",5.0,-1
"These sheets are 100% cotton six hundred thread count with a sateen weave which makes them silky soft. I have the queen size and they fit snugly.

Some wrinkling but not as bad as others I've used. I just remove them from the dryer when they're slightly damp and put them on the bed and smooth them out. I'm a hot sleeper and I find cotton to be the most comfortable for me, And the sateen weave really enhances the softness. I ordered the blue/gray color and it's a very nice rich color. All in all, I'm very happy with these sheets and I would recommend them.",5.0,-1

These, with the softness of the cotton, make a smooth, warm, and comfortable bed for winter, or summer depending on your sleeping warmth preference!!",5.0,-1

"Hotel Brand 600 Thread Count Sheet Set in Queen is so luxurious. I chose the color cream because is such an ease color to blend with other colors. It goes perfectly with the cream and peach comforter that I already have.The Queen set included a flat sheet (94"" x 104""), fitted sheet (60"" x 80"") and pillowcases (21"" x 32"" each).

I have brought Queen sheet sets before and had to struggle to get the fitted sheet to go on the bed and then to stay on the bed. However the fitted sheet that came with this set fits perfectly. Also this set is super soft because of the 100% Egyptian Cotton with Sateen weave its made out of. Its nothing worst than trying go to sleep on scratchy or coarse feeling sheets.

"Bed sheets are supposed to be soft, have that crisp feeling, and breathable; these are it! I do like my sheets to have that rich feeling that I find in most very nice hotels. Upon taking them out of the packaging, I immediately felt the thickness of the material and noticed how well the seams were sewn. Initially, I washed and dried them twice, just to see how they would hold up. I immediately took them out of the dryer, but they were a bit more wrinkled than I prefer, however, they were very soft. When I made up the bed, I again could feel the heaviness of the material; a good thing! Also, the fitted sheet had very deep corner pockets and extra width (easily tucked in), which should fit all queen-size mattresses. The flat sheet fit perfectly and the two full queen-sized pillow cases completed the bed. I wash my sheets in cold water, detergent - Woolite Gentle Cycle, on gentle cycle, extra rinse cycle helps, and no bleach. Dry on low-medium heat, no dryer fabric softener sheets, and take out immediately to reduce creases (scratchy). This seems to help keep my 100% Egyptian Cotton with a Sateen Weave sheets from snagging and balling up (taught this by my mother). The great thing with good 600 thread count Egyptian cotton sheets, properly laundered, is that they get softer and have fewer wrinkles with each wash; iron if you wish. If I could change one thing, I would have added another pair of pillow cases. Bottom line: a good price for great sheets.",5.0,1

"I am a Spark Reviewer for Walmart and was sent a free King sized set of Hotel Style 600 thread count 100% Egyptian Cotton sheets with a Sateen Weave. The set includes 1 flat sheet, 1 fitted sheet and 2 king pillowcases. The set is what I call QUALITY. The sheets are not flimsy like so many are today. The material is woven so you can barely see you hand through them and they have a soft feel to them, but not silky. The flat sheet and pillowcases have a beautiful sateen weave about 4” from the top edge that runs on both sides of the material. It is very soft and pretty. The top sheet is one of the first that I have ever seen that actually is sized for a king sized mattress. I was very surprised when I put the sheets on the bed as to how they fit. I’ll start by saying that I have a 15” thick mattress which puts me about in the middle of mattress thicknesses. The flat top sheet actually hangs off the sides 16” on each side and 18” on the end. This made for easy tucking in on the end of the bed and wonderful sleeping where my husband and I weren’t struggling to have the sheet on both of us at the same time. This means you actually get to cover up with the sheet. The fitted sheet is the best constructed fitted sheet I have ever seen. I also had a lot of room to spare and tuck under, so I know that it will live up to its claims of fitting up to a 20” deep mattress. The corners are deep, and what I really like about it is that it has vertical stretchy elastic so it fit my mattress size securely, but it also has plenty of room for a thicker mattress. The elastic running around the bottom of the fitted sheet is over 1” wide and sewn in very securely. I have never seen a fitted sheet with such wide elastic running around it. There is no struggling to get this sheet on and it tucked under the mattress and held securely through the night. I love the 100% Egyptian cotton because it has that crisper, fresh feeling when you sleep on it. The sheets are not scratchy, they just feel nice, and the best part is cotton breaths which makes them healthier for you to sleep on. I love getting into a cool feeling bed and then snuggling in to warm it up and that’s what the Egyptian cotton sheets allow. One of the things I also really like is when you change positions on the bed or flip your pillow, you get that cooler feeling. I always wash things before use, it’s just a thing that I like to do, so I did wash them before using them. They wash beautifully, and did not shrink. The pretty sateen stitching did not unravel, the elastic edging and corners kept their shapes, and there was very minimal wrinkling. I am not a fan of having to iron sheets and the sheets came out of the dryer with very few wrinkles, so I was more than happy to put them straight from the dryer onto the bed. I chose the white colored sheets just because I like white sheets and the white is such a nice bright white, and easily goes with any decor. I apologize for writing such a long review, but these sheets are truly the best I have ever had. The stars only let me choose up to 5 stars, but really these are a 10.",5.0,1

"Cream color on this a set of king size sheets with a thread count of 600. When you get this item in your hands you will notice that this feels very smooth and has a natural shine to the fabric. The fitted sheet has deep corner pockets with an insert of elastic to fit any mattress. All sides, bottom and top cover the mattress on all sides and tuck nicely under the mattress for a smooth snug fit. I have found that with use this sheet stays in place and continues to hug the mattress with no adjustment needed.

Now you will put on the flat sheet that comes with the sheet set and it has a nice hem all around the edge and a very wide top edge with a slight trim on the top end, but not one with washing that will curl or get to be a problem with use. The top sheet is wide enough and long enough to tuck in at the bottom and easily cover the mattress but not hang to the floor and your quilt or comforter or bedspread will be nicely covering when the bed is made.

Last but certainly not least are the pillow cases that are included. With the king set are king size pillow cases that are big enough to cover the pillow and have a piece on the end to tuck over the pillow so the pillow does not move out of the case. The same trim is noted on the pillow cases as on the top sheet.

The very best about these sheets is the way they feel when you are using them, they feel great and you are cool and do not bunch up when turning about. Nothing feels better than a cool cotton sheet and the 600 thread count is the perfect match for a perfect night’s sleep.

The practical side is that they wash well, do not come out of the dryer with a bunch of wrinkles and do not shrink and continue to fit as when they were first used.",5.0,-1
"These sheets are a little “noisy” for me. My old cotton sheets were a little “stiff” and noisy when first purchased but after a wash they were soft and quiet. This sheet set truly feels like a hotel set of sheets (almost as if they have a little starch). Hotel sheets value “look” over “feel” and this set also seems to do that. They just aren’t super soft! They are, however, very nice and look AMAZING! I especially enjoy the deep fitted sheet- it would fit most any mattress, truly. I have a memory foam and it grips great; hubs generally pulls the fitted sheet off but that hasn’t happened since using this set. As well, the flat sheet is larger than most sets- always love when hubs and I don’t have to fight for inches of bedding! The photo attached shows the roomy pillow cases- my pillows are spa style, extra-large pillows; there is plenty of room in the pillow cases for any pillow. At this time I just have a quilt on our king sized bed; the flat sheet is actually longer than the quilt. I had intended to get a new (larger) comforter or quilt so it wasn’t an issue for me but might be for others.",4.0,-1
"Very comfortable set. smooth and cool. I have a king size bed. Alot of sets i get the fitted cant even grab underneath the mattress and a corner is always left half exposed but this one fits completely. So much that yes it is more material than needed but i know that if were on it, the sheet wont come up off the corners from any weight. Thats a plus in my book !",5.0,-1

"I immediately liked the feel of these sheets when Iopened the package.  They feel substantial, thick, and durable.

"I was looking for a good quality set of sheets on a budget. These aren't exactly “budget” sheets. (For my king sized bed, they cost about $75 with tax. ) but they are about half the price of some of the luxury brands.  And they are very nice! They feel thick and smooth and seem to be very similar to some high quality sheets I've slept in before. Ive only had them one day so I can't speak for how they will hold up to repeated washing, wear and tear but they seem to be very well made and I am very happy with my purchase so far.",5.0,-1

"These sheets are thicker than other sheets that I have. When I took them out of the package, they were smooth to the touch. I laundered them before putting them on the bed. I wanted to see how the fabric would perform on its own so I did not use any fabric softener in the laundry process. When I took them out of the dryer, they were so wrinkled and rough. My guess is because they are 100% cotton, they will always have the wrinkles after they are dried. After laundering, the texture was a little rougher. They were easy to put on the bed and I liked the elastic sewn all the way around the fitted sheet. The elastic made the bottom sheet fit snugly under the mattress. I noticed that the slight roughness of the sheets made it more difficult to roll over in bed without rolling the top sheet with me. The sheets did not seem to soften any during the week I had them on the bed. Overall, the quality is excellent. The stitching appears to be secure. The elastic makes the fitted sheet really fit the bed. They are not as soft as other sheets I have and they are extremely wrinkled. Some fabric softener may solve the softness problem and release some of the wrinkles.",4.0,1

"I love the fit and feel of these sheets. It makes it feel like a different bed. I admit that I have only bought the cheaper sheets before, because I didn't think it would make that big a difference, boy I was wrong. They are 600 thread count. When I took them out of the package, I could tell that they were a more substantial fabric. They have a much thicker elastic band on the fitted sheet that doesn't come off the corner when I sleep on them. I have a 12 thick mattress and can tell it would fit one even thicker. My bed is king sized and this came with a fitted sheet, top sheet and two king pillow cases. I have already bought more of these and thrown the cheap sheets away, because I cannot go back to them now. Obviously I highly recommend these sheets, buy them, sleep well!",5.0,-1

"The Hotel Brand 600 Thread Count King Sheet Set in Arctic White is very comfortable. This sheet set includes a king size flat sheet (110"" x 104""), king size extra-deep fitted sheet (78"" x 80"") and 2 king size pillowcases (21"" x 40"" each). Optifit technology allows for the fitted sheet to fit mattresses sizes 9 to 20 inches deep. The corners are stretchable to allow the sheet to stay in place. They are made of 100 % Egyptian cotton and they feature sateen weave for ultimate comfort. These sheets can be machine laundered and I actually recommend tossing them in the laundry before the first use. It makes the sheets softer and they won’t have that new stiffness feeling. According to the label they need to be washed in warm water with no bleach, but I washed them in hot water with no issues. I tumbled dried them on medium heat and took them out of the dryer promptly and they did not wrinkle. Most of my sheet sets are 800 thread count or higher, but these 600 count sheets are just as comfortable as my more expensive higher thread count sheets. The Hotel Brand 600 count sheet sets are available in more colors and sizes online at Wal-Mart.Com. I highly recommend these comfy sheets.",5.0,-1

"When I saw that Spark Reviewer had the Hotel Brand, 600 Thread Count Sheet Set in White for a Queen-sized bed, I was happy. I’ve had my current sheets for quite a while and they needed replaced, but good sheets can be so expensive that I’ve been putting it off. I’m glad I had the opportunity to try these. When I washed them before using them I noticed the washing machine seemed fuller than it does when I wash my usual sets. I was curious how the sheets could fit mattresses with thicknesses ranging between 9 and 20 inches since that’s quite a difference in size. The inside corner of the fitted sheet has a piece of elastic that allows for the size difference and also makes it easier to make the bed. I have a 12-inch mattress and it fits nicely. The elastic around the bottom of the fitted sheet is an inch thick. The pillow cases are a little roomier than my others. Apparently most companies make standard size cases for queen sets. The care instructions for these 100% Egyptian cotton sheets are to machine wash warm, tumble dry low, and iron on medium if needed. They were a little wrinkly but not so bad I was going to iron them! There was a crinkling sound the sheets made at first, but they seem to be softening up and it’s not so noticeable now. These are very good quality and I would buy more of this brand.",5.0,-1

"I love these sheets! they are so nice and soft, and I love that they stay warm and keep you cool at the same time. As any menopausal woman will tell you, finding a good combination of bedclothes is a difficult task, at best, and nearly impossible at the height of a hot flash! These Hotel Brand 600 Thread Count Sheet Set - Cream, Queen are great! I washed them when they first arrived and was surprised at the weight of them - quite heavy for a sheet set. They washed and dried fine, and had barely a wrinkle to them when they came out of the dryer, and were even softer than when they went into the wash. The fitted sheet was difficult to fold because the elastic goes around the entire bottom and it is a full 1(one) inch wide! The fitted corners also had the elastic to accommodate very deep mattresses. My mattress is 12 inches deep and has a 4 inch foam topper and the sheets fit with plenty of sheet to go underneath, so they stay on. I haven't spilled anything on them, so I don't know how they will be so far as that, but so far, I love them.",5.0,-1
"I received these 600 thread count king-size sheets through the Spark Reviewer Program. I waited as long as I could to write the review because I wanted to see how they washed and fit the bed after washing a couple of times. I washed them first before using and was very happy with the first washing. They were soft and silky feeling and dried fairly wrinkle-free. I did take them out of the dryer immediately so I'm sure that added to the nice appearance. They were plenty big enough for my king-size mattress, in fact, could have fit a little more snug, but that's because we have an older mattress which isn't near as thick as the newer ones. Our mattress is only 11 inches deep as opposed to some of the much deeper ones which are now available. However, they worked well enough and looked and felt very nice. This type of fabric isn't my fabric of choice for winter weather as I prefer something warmer like flannel or fleece, but feel these will be perfect when warmer weather gets here. After the second washing, I didn't see any difference in the size. Still nice and soft and found nothing to change my mind about the quality or the way they laundered and dried. Very happy with my selection!",5.0,-1
"This is a free product I received as a participant of WalMarts’ Spark Review process established to help prospective buyers shop confidently, be informed and to aid in a positive shopping experience. Hotel Brand 600 Thread Count Sheet Set - Cream, King. I am pleasantly surprised with Hotel Brand 600 Thread Count sheet set. These sheets have a beautiful luxurious feel, shimmer and crispness to the fabric. 100% Egyptian Cotton, made in India, these sheets are machine washable per the care label. I ordered the Kind size in the cream color. The color is true to the description cream. There is fine thread detailing trim to this set which adds to the luxurious appeal. There is stretch to the fitted sheet allowing for a snug secure fit to your mattress fitting from 9 to 20 inches deep. The corners have been thoughtfully fitted to stay smoothly in place. The pillow case sizes are 21 inches by 40 inches which are generous in size covering your king size pillow completely. The king size flat sheet measures 110 inches by 104 inches. I’ve enclosed a picture sample showing the label details for your review. Importantly, these sheets feel great against the skin, they wash nicely without losing their appeal and have only gotten softer without shrinkage when washing and drying. Walmart shipped to me via FedEx packaged in a box. I am very happy with these sheets, would recommend to my family and friends for not only their quality, comfort and feel but the price is makes them worth it.

The fan on high is awesome and really makes the bedroom cold.  It is sturdy (zero wobble) and quiet. My big disappointment was finding out that it did not have SimpleConnect functionality like the 60” Brunswick.  When I purchased on Hunterfans.com, the SimpleConnect filter showed both. Sadly, I never got it working on the 60”, so maybe it wouldn't have worked on this one either, even if it did come with the feature.

They wash well, are wrinkle free/resistant and do not fade, do not develop pills or fall apart. I would call them -good hotel- quality/grade and are surprisingly affordable. The material is not that awful so called silky texture other  brands claim to have.  We like these so much that we ordered three more sets last week including one set for the guest room.

While the sheets fit pocket to pocket, they are too short on the sides and expose the side of the mattress cover by about 4"". It is not a full fit and it looks tacky. They would probably fit well on a 10"" mattress. Also, the top sheet could be about 3"" longer on both sides and the pillow cases barely fit a standard size pillow with little material remaining at the opening.

That is an amazing generous fitted sheet that will fit the new style of very thick pillow top mattresses, or you can do what we did and purchase from WalMart.com a new mattress to put on TOP of an older worn king set, and save a ton on money. We now see when our topper wears out we can buy a thicker one and still find fitted sheets that fit. The construction of these sheets and pillow cases is done with pride, and it shows. Very nice color that will go with anyone bedroom. I say for certain order a set you will love them.",5.0,1
"To be honest when I was growing up we bought sheets at the thrift store and used those. When I got my own place, I bought the cheapest on the shelf and used those. Never one to travel much. These arrived very quickly. Nicely packaged. The first thing I noticed was the weight. To me, the package felt heavy for a box of sheets. Once I got the package home and on the table, I opened the box to discover the sheets were a beautiful color. I read the package. 100% egyptian cotton with sateen weave. I could not possible explain how many hours of my life, on how many different visits I have spent standing in the bedding isle looking at sheets. Yes, just standing there debating. Only to walk away, telling myself I would get a good quality set another time. But that time really never came. Anyways, the set is one size bigger then what my bed is only because I have neck and spinal damage and I found it is less painful for me to get it on and tuck it under. I can see making the beds will eventually become a kid chore around my house. Once we got it on and tucked, we jumped in bed to try them out. My daughter and I. She said they felt so soft and silky. I found the weight of the sheet, which is a bit heavier then the cheapest ones we have been using added a bit of quality comfort allowing us to sleep much deeper, longer. No matter how much tossing or turning I did, the sheets never balled up, and the material stayed silky smooth. the lesser sheets tend to feel like sand paper after a while. I toss and turn a lot due to pain. To be honest I never felt nor used sheets like this before now. Just knew that the better thread count meant better sheets, was not sure how. After using and reviewing these, I cannot see myself without them. I guess what it boils down to is... There is nothing wrong with cheaper sets of sheets. But if you want to have a high quality sleep on sheets that are extremely soft, sheets that will last and last, I would highly recommend these sheets. As a person with painful disabilities, sleeping is the most painful thing above all else day or night. Using these sheets allowed me to toss and turn less, sleep deeper, with out all the other issues the cheaper sheets caused. I would highly recommend weather it be your investing into bedding or just unsure of going to a better thread count. I would say after this a better thread count really does make a world of difference.",5.0,1
"Hotel Style Queen 600 Thread Count Sheet Set
100% Egyptian Cotton with Sateen Weave

Out of the box the Hotel Style Queen 600 Thread Count Sheet Set 100% Egyptian Cotton with Sateen Weave was soft and very shinny. The Sheet Set advertised to have Optifit Technology which means the fitted sheet fits mattresses up to 20 inch deep. My bed is exactly 20 inches deep and I had a difficult time placing the fitted sheet on the mattress and I had to get help to place the fitted sheet on my mattress. I was so overjoyed to discover that the pillow cases were generous in size also that I could place two standard pillows in one pillow case. When the bed was made up it did look very pretty but living in the northeast the temperature was quite cold around 17 degrees and although my bedroom was warm, when I laid between the sheets I felt cold and slippery which was not too pleasing to me. I immediately took the sheet set off and replaced it with my warm inviting flannel sheet set. I washed and dried the 100% Egyptian Cotton with Sateen Weave sheet set and found pilling on the sheet set and it wrinkled a lot.

I wanted to be fair with this review so I ironed the sheets and placed the sheet set on a bed in my Guest Room. This mattress is approximately 18 inches deep and was easy to place on the mattress without help. The bed did look clean and crisp and ready for my Nephews overnight visit. My Nephew informed that he found the sheet set soft and inviting, but cool to the touch. He did advise me that it might be better if I would use this sheet set in the summer months which might help to keep the bed cool, which I do agree with my Nephew’s suggestion.",3.0,1
"Treat yourself to a great nights sleep with Hotel Style 600 thread count sheet sets. These luxurious sheet sets are soft cozy and help you get a good nights sleep.

I really like these sheets because they are soft and cozy. So cozy in fact, that I didn't want to get out of bed in the morning. Hotel Brand 600 thread count sheets are 100% Egyptian cotton, are machine washable and come in many sizes styles and colors.

"After owning the eggplant color set for over a year they are still in great condition! The sound goes away after a couple washings. And youre left with sheets that wonât come off every night bc they have this wonderful wide elastic around the bottom. I found another sheet set with that wide elastic band from kohls (Columbia brand I think) but they were twice the cost of these.  We have a california king mattress but the regular king sheets, stay on and fit just fine. Highly recommend!",5.0,1
"These sheets are definitely worth the price.  After buying so many high priced sheet sets for my king sized bed, these are the only ones that did not pill.  Many other expensive sets pilled after just a month or two while these have lasted over a year thus far.  Wife and I are rough on sheet sets, so this was important.

Durability aside, they are smooth and cool night after night.  Some of the best sheets I have ever used.",5.0,-1
"Really not soft and very wrinkly.  I needed to replace Select Edition sheets which are now discontinued.  These sheets were the right color.  They felt smooth out of the package but they are not after washing.  I washed again using extra fabric softener but still rough feeling.  And they wrinkle terribly.  I am too old to iron sheets!  The weight of the fabric is good, the got is good but the feel is bad.  Bring back Select Edition and Better Homes sheets.  They were better.",3.0,-1
"I love these sheets so much, I just bought my 6th set - 4 for me, 1 for my sister, 1 for my daughter.  First, they are so luxuriously soft, and I'm not rich, but my bed is covered in wonderful cotton.  The colors are beautiful (although they are running out, if seems, of a lot of colors and haven't restocked them).  2nd, the fitted sheet has an elastic strip all the way around it and up the corners.  There's no stretching to get it to fit your mattress.  They are perfect in every way.  I don't need any more for a long time because I am stocked up for both beds and colors for winter and summer bedding.  These are the only sheets that go on my beds now.",5.0,-1
Was worth the price. Very deep pockets on fitted sheet and ample for any size deep mattress almost to big. Has tags to tell you top or bottom on fitted sheet. So soft feel.

"I love these sheets.  They are very well made and stay in place when you make the bed.  They don't slide or stretch around like the microfiber sheets.  The fitted sheet fits perfect. The flat sheet is a longer than most flat sheets, so it stays tucked under the foot of the mattress... which makes me happy (I don't have to remake the bed everyday because the top (flat) sheet pulls out).  Highly recommend.",5.0,-1

"I bought these fabulous sheets for my mothers beds in her 5 bedroom house back in February 2020 which was an in-store purchase. Her sheets were constantly needing straps on the corners for her very deep-pocketed mattresses since there were extra layers of all sorts of padding on the Queen mattresses. Let me tell you, the strong elastic on these fitted sheets can not be compared to ANY sheets I've ever purchased in my 72 years. I even use them on the full size mattress she has in one of the rooms since that elastic pulls the sheet snug to the full size mattress also ! I'm purchasing more Queen today on-line for my own skinny full size mattress in my apartment. The quality of these 600 thread sheets is just right for the long, hot summers here in Florida. The only thing that keeps me from giving them 5 stars is if you don't get them out of the dryer right away they do wrinkle.",4.0,-1

"Five stars for the exceptional quality of these-- they are very well-made. The extra deep pockets are one of the best features, especially if you have a very thick mattress.

I recommend these sheets.",5.0,-1

I've had higher thread count sheets that rip and get worn easily, but at 600 these are a good happy medium-- smooth and soft but they don't seem like they'll wear and year easily.

"I am absolutely in love with these sheets . This is my first pair of cotton sateen sheets and I really don't know what I have been missing! Upon opening them as soon as you touch these you know they are not your typical budget sheets. These have a very luxurious and premium feel. The 600 thread count feels like it is a higher thread count. These are very nice and thick and cool to the touch. Slept amazing through the night with great comfort. I am also loving the gray pumice color i recieved. I washed and dried upon opening and there is no wrinkling from the sheets at all . The set comes with your usual fitted,flat,and 2 pillow covers. The pillow covers are just as premium as the sheets . They have a beautiful thick feel to them and they are oh so spacious to accommodate all sizes of pillows whether it be down,memory foam , plump ,firm,feather etc. the sheets seem to stay on the mattress very well and have a very nice elastic on them. Mine are on a 3 “ mattress topper and the sheets still fit and look absolutely beautiful . Already gotten a few compliments from family members about these sheets so I 100% would reccomend this set of bedsheets and any product from the hotel style brand. They really hit it out of the park with this pima cotton set so do not hesitate to order these sheets or any other bedding items from hotel style!

They kind of reminded me of the sheets my mother had when I was a kid— I am 65.  they seem to be made well,  easy to get on the bed,  to the thin side but a good quality.  I have washed them twice and they come out of the dryer very wrinkly.  they are still smooth with no pills.

"Overall I liked the sheets. The teal color is beautiful. They feel a little thicker than the sheets I had before but that's fine because the weather started getting colder. Unfortunately they also feel stiffer. I took one star away because of this. Hoping over time and after a more washes the sheets will soften. As silly as it sounds, what I like best about the sheet set is that they labeled 2 sides of the fitted sheet with a tag that says ""top or bottom"". I've never seen that before and thought it was very clever. Figuring out which side of the fitted sheet goes on which side of the mattress can be annoying sometimes.

"The Hotel Brand 600 Thread Count Sheet Set has been a luxurious addition to our bedding. We have the King size set in white, and we really can’t say enough great things about the quality of these sheets. They are made with pure Egyptian 600 Thread Count Cotton, which gives them a soft, clean feel. It did take a couple of washes to make them really soft, but I prefer the very little bit of “crispness” you get with brand new sheets. I love falling into my bed with these sheets on at the end of the day! Immediately upon receiving the sheet set, I threw them in the washer and dryer. The sheets dried very quickly, and they came out of the dryer wrinkle free, which is a very nice feature. However, I did read that you need to take them out of the dryer immediately or they will wrinkle (as you can see from the attached photo). The fitted sheet has a thick elastic band around it making a snug fit on either an extra tall mattress or a thinner mattress. My only complaint about the Hotel Brand Sheet Set is that it only came with 2 king size pillow cases, when I really need four pillow cases. The King set includes a flat sheet (110"" x 104""), fitted sheet (78"" x 80"") and 2 pillowcases (21"" x 40"" each). Overall, I would highly recommend Hotel Brand 600 Thread Count Sheet Set to anyone looking for a luxury sheet set at a more affordable price.",4.0,1
"For $65.oo I think a person would expect something really good right out of the package, however these sheets were so wrinkled I almost stuffed them back in the pk.  They were hard for me to get on the bed alone, they kept squirting back off due to being so tight with elasticity.   I do like that part as they stay on the bed and won't pull off.  They are not soft so don't expect that but they are what I wanted which is a sheet that won't get wrapped  up and trip you when you are trying to get out of the bed.  They are a thick material that gives the feeling of a starched sheet. They were much better after being washed with some softener, but still wrinkle easily.",2.0,1
"These sheets are the thickest sheets I have ever owned. I bought a king size set in our Florida 2nd home at Walmart and decided to buy 2 more sets for home. These sheets have the deepest pockets of all and they are 20 inches. We have a thick mattress plus we have a 3"" topper so these sheets fit perfectly.",5.0,1

I think the cotton will soften up after a few washings. It doesnâ€™t have duvet ties in the corners which is too bad. Iâ€™m going sew in my own.

These hotel style 600 thread count luxury cotton sheets are amazing!

It holds the sheet SO well and the sheets will fit deep mattresses easily. The bonus with the new set? OMG why hasn't anyone done this before?? There's a tag sewn in the top and bottom of the fitted sheet SHOWING you which sides are top and bottom!!!

"I bought these in cream Paisley. They're great! Very comfortable, well made, beautiful pattern, high quality feeling fabric. The fitted sheet has a wide elastic band that goes all the way around.

I think the people who gave them low reviews must prefer a sateen sheet, which is warmer and softer.

"LOVE! My mother in law bought a set for my son and I had been trying to figure out for the longest time where she got them.

"I bought one set of these in our local Walmart with caution as I have been looking for sheets that were smooth and cool just like the ones I grew up with.  These are the ones  and they make it easy to slide out of bed without bunching and catching on your pjs. Their smooth cool finish is wonderful and they are tightly woven and cotton! They have generous deep pockets for the deeper mattresses and a nice heavy weight. I loved them so much, I ordered three more sets online.  I wish they had more colors.",5.0,-1
"These are relatively thick sheets and the size of each item in the set is very adequate for my queen size bed.   The elastic band on the fitted sheet is almost an inch wide and seems of high quality.  However, these sheets felt fairly soft in the package, but the first wash rinsed off whatever chemical made them feel soft at first.  I have washed them several times per the instructions and even added fabric softener, they feel like high grit sandpaper.  I will give these a few more washes and if they don't soften up, they will be returned.
Earlier, I bought the 500TC sheets at Walmart.  They look very similar to these in every way.  They were very scratchy at first, but have softened some with weeks of washing.  Not sure these 600TC are worth the extra money over the 500TC.",2.0,-1

"I have had my GelPro Elite for about  2 weeks now and I can really feel the improvement. I love to cook and on some days spend many hours standing at the counter. My legs, feet, and back are not nearly as weary now that I’m standing on the mats. I’m only 5’2” so I also appreciate the slight height gain on the counter. However, when we do dishes (we don’t have a dishwasher), I take my shoes off while standing on the mat because the extra height makes for just enough more of a reach to the bottom of the sink that my back suffers. Only slight drawback is that they are heavy to move when cleaning the floor. Benefits outweigh this drawback.",5.0,-1

Also, they do not stay in place at all, I am always having to put them back every time I finish standing on them.  They are very expensive and wish these two issues could be resolved.",3.0,-1

If kitchen floor is not 100% dry after cleaning or if you spill water on the floor and it gets under the mat, the mat doesn’t breathe at all. Also the 72 inch is so heavy, it makes it very difficult to pick it up and clean. I will not be spending more money on another gel pro. It was comfortable to stand on, but not worth the hassle.",2.0,-1

I bought this as a gift for my mom who is 87 years old. She thanks me every day for the comfort it gives her. It not only looks good but when my mom cooks her feet and her back do not feel the pain she once had. I recommend this highly. It may be pricey but the amount paid does not out way the comfort and help it provides.,5.0,-1
I just got my mat in the mail. It feels like walking on clouds which my entire floor would feel this good. It's  soft and looks great next to the bed. I love waking up and stepping down on it before putting on my slippers. It's heavy and doesn't move around to make me slip. I recommend this to anyone ... especially if you stand by the stove cooking or washing dishes all day long. Thanks,5.0,-1
"We had a Classic for 20 years.  When we remodeled our kitchen, we selected the Plush line over the Elite since it offered the vinyl backing.  We love the Plush line.  Unfortunately, the Plush is no longer available so we opted to try the Elite.  While the manufacturer claims this is new and improved over Plush, we are disappointed.  Rubber backing can't be cleaned like the vinyl can, so that is the first complaint.  Secondly, the rubber backing doesn't hold up.   So YES, it is comfortable and does the job,in a kitchen we want to clean the mats if there are spills ... and rubber just doesn't hold up.   Classic has vinyl but it isn't nearly as comfortable as the Plush...but the Elite rubber is not favored in our home.  So sad it has been discontinued!  We probably will have to replace the Elite sooner than the Plush model due to the bottom material.  Too bad they didn't consider eliminating Classic instead of Plush..in my opinion.",3.0,-1

Gel Pro honored their fantastic warranty within hours of my email showing the problem. New mats were shipped, I've chosen the Adelle in warm tea. I am loving the lighter color, and this new pattern! My feet & back absolutely love these mats, I will never be without one again. My only one problem with them is I cannot keep them in place, I am constantly moving them back in place. I do not know what the answer is to keep them from doing this. Maybe is is due to the slight texture in my flooring. I do recommend these mats though, your feet, hips & back will thank you!",4.0,-1

The fit for the sofa and loveseat was perfect.  The texture of the covers are thick and soft with a quilted back to stop it from sliding along with the side straps to hold it down.  The covers have no problems in staying in place on my micro suede set that has built in pillow backs.  I thought it would look kind of lumpy but they are large enough that the covers have room to spare to cover loosely across the pillow tops. Actually mine look exactly as is fitted on the picture.  Sorry I haven't taken any pics of it as of yet.  Also they are thick enough to absorb any spills.",5.0,-1

Out of the dryer they were extremely wrinkled and no longer nearly as soft.  The weave seemed to get even  tighter.  The fabric was  so taunt and thick it felt more like a heavy  canvas material.  I was so irritated  I almost returned them .  Now many months later they have softened back up quite a bit and the wrinkles smooth themselves  out  when put on the bed.   Still nowhere nearly as soft as day one, (that was amazing). Ive become addicted to the heavy feel of the fabric.     Nice color, excellent stitching, no pilling.  Long lasting.  No apparent wear what so ever.   I have grown to love them.",5.0,-1

Unless the seat width is exactly 45"" (inside arm to inside arm) it does not fit as shown in the picture. The OVERALL length of my loveseat is 65"", and the seat portion of this cover is at least 9"" too short on each end.

The strap which is supposed to attach the back part of the cover to the arm piece to hold it in place is not long enough, as several other customers have mentioned.",3.0,1

"I contacted GelPro customer service a couple a weeks ago about a problem I was experiencing with my mats that I had purchased over five years ago. A customer service representative - Nancy Crowley - called me within a day to discuss my problem and offered her assistance. I am now the proud owner of new Gelpro mats for my kitchen and I could not be more happy with them. Not only are they attractive but they are so comfortable I could stand on them all day. They are the best mats ever.
I would be remiss in my review if I did not say something about GelPro customer service. They are one of the finest examples of what customer service should be. It has become rare for companies today to treat their customers with respect and listen to their problems. GelPro's customer service placed the customer first and then provided the best service possible. They are outstanding. I would recommend GelPro products without reservations.

This cover has panels that tuck down very well but I opened the end of each and inserted the Tuck grip. I fitted and used the straps to secure and tucked it in as far as I could. Wow!

"I have had my two new Elite mats for about a month now. They are so comfortable when I have to stand for long periods of time and look really nice as well! I wish that the Elite came in other sizes, as the 20"" x 48"" makes for a narrow mat that can't fit under the toe kick of the cabinets and offer enough exposed mat for your feet. One minor issue I am having is that the mats do move around on the floor when walked on. They are heavy, so it is minimal, but they do not stay in place. I have travertine tile floors with a matte finish, maybe that is why? I do find that I need to adjust the placement often. If they could fit under the toe kick, there would at least be something to keep it in place. Other than that, they are great!",5.0,-1

After looking at different brands and types of foot mats I decided to get the GelPro Elite. It just feels wonderful to stand on and my feet and back no longer hurt after standing at the sink for a while. I can't recommend these mats enough. The variety of styles and colors are unbelievable!

"Any time that I've worked in the kitchen cooking and cleaning up afterwards, I spend the night with my feet and ankles on ice, and they still ached the next day.
After I bought the Gel Elite Pro mats, I've not had that problem since! The Atlantic Blue is gorgeous and I love the beveled edges. As directed, I carefully clean up any water or other items that fall on the mats. Since I am sloppy when washing dishes, I am wiping water up quite a bit. But, unlike water on the floor, the mats don't get slippery or unsafe, just wet. I bought 2 mats to cover the sink/side counter and stove/side counter. My husband likes them in different places around the counter, so when the time comes to replace them, I will buy 2-36 inch long mats, and 2-32 inch mats for the counters. That way we can easily move the 32 inch mats to other areas and keep the longer ones in front of the sink/stove. You will be surprised to see how well the mats are packaged, and the Customer Service at Gel Pro is second to none!!! I would strongly encourage anyone who wants a great mat to protect their back or feet, spend the money to buy a decent Gel Pro mat. Put the cheap, inferior ones in the garage.",5.0,-1

"Looking for soft cotton/sateen pillowcases, these felt soft only to the touch of my fingers so I thought it was going to be ok.  Washed/dried them, took them out of the dryer and even though dried in perm. press, they came our so wrinkled! I tried to soften them with my hands to no avail. They are very rough on my face, just horrible and they cost me 16.99 and I can't return them UGH!!!

"Hotel Style? Then these sheets are either from a tacky $80/night honeymoon suite or from one of those ""hotels"" that rent rooms by the hour.

"I've owned these for four months and they're the most disappointing quality. Instead of becoming softer with washing, they've become scratchy and after about 2 months it started to get those little balls. Horrible.

"Why do they have to go and mess with a good thing. Walmart use to sell select edition 600 thread count sheets. They were soft and held up to repeated wear and washing. They were much thicker and softer than this new style.  I had three pairs and rotated them weekly.  As with any high thread count sheet set the fitted sheet wear out eventually.  But, for the money they were wonderful sheets. Still using the flat sheet and pillow cases. Walmart discontinued the select edition brand and now sell these sheets instead. They are not as thick, or as soft and have not held up as well. The elastic on the fitted sheet has stretched out and now I have to tuck the excess under the box spring. Not happy with these sheets wish they would bring back the select edition brand!! If you had purchased the select edition sheets you would not be happy with this new style.",1.0,1

"I loved the better homes and garden sheets but they are not carrying them now in the store so I bought the Hotel Style 600 thread count sheet set in an ivory color.  They are the worst sheets.  They state to be 100 percent Egyptian cotton but they feel like sandpaper.  They wash up terrible and have so many wrinkles in them that if I were to keep them I would have to iron them.  Terrible sheets for the money paid.  I will be going elsewhere since Walmart decided to push these knock off brands instead of the better homes and garden sheets, which I might add wash up like a dream with no wrinkles and soft as could be.  Terrible decision on Walmarts part to push these in their place. If something works why  mess with it?  Geez...",1.0,1

"I love these sheets and this is a great price! I have been hunting for a good pair of sheets for a few months now and these are perfect. Cool, crisp, soft and with a good weight to them. These remind me of the sheets my Grandma had. They are cotton so they will wrinkle, not too bad straight from the dryer though. They are also ""noisy"" as other reviewers stated but that doesn't bother me, only adds to their appeal. I have a 12 inch mattress and these fit perfectly. If you are used to microfiber sheets these will seem rough but they will continue to soften up with washing. I think these will last for quite some time and I plan on purchasing more as soon as they have the King size back in stock. Very satisfied customer.",5.0,1

"I can't believe people are complaining that they wrinkle in the dryer, like their sheets who sees your sheets on your bed under a blanket? The wrinkles fall out within a couple of hours after making your bed anyway.
These sheets are amazing and only get softer as you wash them. I'm a very picky sleeper and struggled with sheets for a long time.  800 count was too soft and silkly and 300 count was too rough and polyester sheets were just awful. 
So at Walmart I would legit open up the zipper part of the package and stick my hand in and feel the sheets and these felt OK but I was skeptical bc I have brought sheets home before that felt OK and were awful ( I have a closet full of sheets that I don't use) as soon as I took these out of the package I was so happy and couldn't wait to go to bed.  
I washed them a week later and when I went to go make my bed with wrinkled sheets ( not that I care)  they were only softer than before and by the time I went to bed the wrinkles were gone.
I went and got another pair of the sheets in navy blue as I got my first pair in gray. They sleep well with my T Shirt Jersey Duvet Cover thats over my Martha Stewart Down Comforter.
I'm a extremely picky sleeper,  I have to sleep a certain a way I've been like this all my life. I don't want to say how much I've spent on bedding or how frustrating it has been in my life trying to find the right fit for me as 100% cotton is not cheap and I do remember back in the early 2000s late 90s the bed in the bags at Walmart used to be 100% cotton and now they changed it to 100% polyester and I think I found a solution instead of paying $200 for a decent Comforter buy a $30 Comforter from Walmart and spend $100 on a decent duvet cover and put that $30 Walmart Comforter in the $100 duvet cover or I'm sure you can find a cheaper duvet cover. 
I do highly recommend these sheets. Who cares about the wrinkles it's not like your bed is going to be viewed by the public and the wrinkles will fall out within a few hours after making your bed.
I also suggest when buying these sheets if you have 4 pillows to grab extra pillowcases so all of your pillows are extra comfy as the sheets only come with two and you can get a pack of two for $16, I think.",5.0,-1
These have to be the worst sheets I have ever purchased. $70 for king size sheets is not cheap and I feel like I am sleeping on a paper bag. After washing multiple times the sheets still feel rough and come out of the dryer extremely wrinkly as if they were balled up wet and stuffed in a dark corner to dry somewhere. Even tried ironing them and the wrinkles still remain.  Horrible horrible product. I never write reviews and typically don't complain but I am livid that I wasted $70.,1.0,-1
"I debated on the 400 thread count vs the 600 in these sheets. I chose the 600 because I had heard on The Today Show that between 550-600 is the best thread count for sheets because it is a medium range and the higher you go the stiffer they become so I was excited to buy these.  At the store, I unzipped the package just enough to feel the texture. They felt cottony soft!  I was thinking good thread count and they felt soft and I was so excited to buy these. I had a $45 gift card so I thought I would splurge!  Otherwise I would have gotten a less expensive set.  When I got home, I took them out of the packaging and put them in the wash.  They washed up well then I put them in the dryer.  After drying them, I got them out and WOW!!  They were sooooooo wrinkled and stiff!  I am NOT ironing sheets so therefore they went on the bed wrinkled. The fit was great. I purchased King size and I found them larger than the normal King size but I guess the overall accommodation for the thicker mattresses (up to 20 inches) is the reason they were bigger. My experience with these sheets is they felt like they were heavily starched!  They were so noisy when moving around in the bed and the second worst thing is they are HOT!  I have also learned the higher the thread count the hotter sheets are so again, I was thinking 600 thread count is a medium scale.  I am extremely disappointed in these sheets!!!  Not what I expected at all especially upon feeling how soft and luxurious they felt before their first wash.  After a restless and sweaty night of sleep on them, the next day I washed them again in straight up fabric softener and added additional fabric softener during the rinse cycle but it didn't make a difference!  The pillowcases could actually almost stand up on their own due to how stiff they are!  However, these sheets are very nice quality and the color is gorgeous. I bought the cream mist which actually is a very pale, soft yellow color.  But if you are truly wanting a comfortable, cozy, soft sheet then these do not meet that criteria. I don't recommend them for that reason and I wish I could return them for a full refund. Now I have $70 sheets that I wish I didn't have.  If you like hot, scratchy, extremely stiff, noisy sheets then you can have these. lol",1.0,-1

"These sheets are alright. I like the different choices of colors, patterns, and style. I ended up with the Cream Paisley Pattern ones after trial and error of matching colors.

However they seemed more crisp and less soft and a little loud sounding. Hoping over time of use and future wash with fabric softener that will get better. They seem lighter and more breathable than my old microfiber ones, but again, less soft.

The print is only on one side.

These sheets are terrible to sleep on. Very scratchy on the skin. After I purchased the sheets I washed them according to directions. They fit beautifully my bed. I love the deep pockets and the full elastic banding. I have slept on them for 2 night now and needless to say i have not slept good at all. Last night by 1am i was ripping the sheets and pillowcases off of my bed and replacing them with my old sheets! I will be returning them ASAP. I spent nearly $100 for thr sheet set plus a coordinating service of king pillowcases. Not at all worth the money. I only gave them 2 stars because I like the functional design of the fitted sheet. Other than that they are terrible,2.0,1
I purchased these sheets expecting them to be somewhat soft considering the thread count and price. They are awful! Very stiff and scratchy. I washed them 6 times over the last two days hoping to soften them up and they are still scratchy and uncomfortable. I wish I could return them. Will never buy this brand again.,1.0,1
"Bought the 400 thread count and loved them so thought the 600 would be even better.  You wouldn't think they were made by the same manufacturer.  Washed the sheets first of course and noticed right away how wrinkly they were.  They looked awful but i didn't care.  But when sleeping on them, could not sleep at all because they were so uncomfortable, they were very stiff, very scratchy, and extremely noisy.  Don't know how the other reviews found them soft unless they had different manufacturers.  I am taking the wrinkly, scratchy things back!  BTW  they were also very hot, could not sleep with the comforter with the sheets.  VERY DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS BUY!  Would not recommend to anyone who wants soft sheets.",1.0,1
"So far these sheets are crisp and not very soft.  They have only been washed once so I am hoping they will soften with additional washing and use.  One reviewer said they are ""noisy"" and I tend to agree.  They remind me of something that has been line-dried in the sun...stiff.  Also, my mattress is 13 inches deep and these sheets fit just about right.  I would be very hesitant to use on a bed that had a thicker mattress.  The sheets also wrinkle slightly after being dried.  100% cotton tends to do that.  If you are looking for easy care I would look for a cotton blend.",3.0,1
"Just purchased the Hotel Style 600 Thread Count Sheet Set- King size. I like how it has deep sides, so it fits my mattress. The pattern and the look of the sheets are very impressive. 
HOWEVER,  the feel of the material is not soft. To the touch, it feels smooth, almost silky, but even when washed correctly,  it almost sounds like plastic sheets and extremely noisy. My husband and I make jokes about this. The pillowcase are rough against my face and in the morning, it is like a beard burn next to my eye/cheeks area. Later in the day, it continues to hurts to the touch on my face. Because I spent close to $70, I was hoping for a more 'luxury' feel. My hope is after 100 washes, it will finally break down the fiber and become softer over time. Feeling disappointed.",3.0,1
"I bought a pair a few years ago and loved them, they were really soft and washed great. I needed a new set so I bought the same 600 tc white sheets as I had before and they are awful.  They are so scratchy and rough its like sleeping on sandpaper. They were also really wrinkly and they look terrible on my bed.  I have sensitive skin and I can't stand to sleep with them.  The first pair I got were perfect. They are defineltly not worth they money I spent on them.",1.0,1
"I bought these sheets over the weekend. It cost more than I expected for a Walmart item but I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt. They look great in the package and it said it was 600 thread ct. Egyptian cotton. I didn't think I could go wrong.

We brought it home, washed it, add fabric softener and it still felt like sand paper. What a waste of $$$. 

The next day I went to Costco and bought way better sheet for half the price and only 400 thread ct. and they feel like silk (100% cotton).

"I purchased a queen-size set of this brand yesterday (Hotel Style - Sateen weave - 600TC).  I washed all 4 pieces this morning.  Everything looked fine until I tried to fold the pillow cases.  One of them was cut or sewn crooked.  It would not flatten out.  When I put it on the pillow, I made the corners line up with the corners of the pillow but the seam wound its way from the edge and across the face of the pillow.  It's like the case was twisted.  If this had been sold as ""seconds"" at half price or something, I would have been ok with it but I paid full price.  I exchanged that set for another.  I'm hoping this new sheet set has no similar issues after going through the laundry.",3.0,1
"I did not get these for the bed, I was wanting higher thread count fabric to make masks and sheets are more cost effective .I have sheets from 185tc to 1200tc and NONE are so scratchy. I washed and dried with a softener sheet and brushed against my face... ROUGH very rough .Solid structure, good thread count but scratchy and  definitely not good for the inside/face side of a mask. Still useable though and much thicker than the ""see thru"" fabric that was 10dollars a yard so... yay for that.",2.0,-1
"Guess I should have known that if something fits 9-20 inches it will be too big for the smaller mattress.   My mattress is not a pillow top and is only about 9 inches deep.  The sheet will actually cover mattress and boxspring!  It keeps wrinkling up because it is just too big.  Big mistake if you have regular size mattress.  As far as the feel of the sheet, it is like polished cotton and I agree it is ""noisy.""",1.0,-1
Sheet set is a very nice weight and feels like a percale.  Also has deep pockets and pillow cases are roomy (Queen) and a great length and will accommodate a fairly thick pillow.  I love these sheets and am only disappointed that I can get another set  but can't get two extra pillow cases as I did when I ordered my set.  Can't understand why it got so few stars!  Love them!,5.0,-1
"SUPER SCRATCHY, STIFF, WRINKLY SHEETS!! Higher thread count does not mean softer or better quality! The only things I actually like about these sheets are that the pockets are big enough to fit around our huge memory foam king mattress, and the colors...that's it!
After following washing instructions exactly and already owning and washing these sheets over the course of several months, they are STILL stiff and starchy feeling! And noisy! Also, no matter how quickly I pull them out of the dryer, they're always SO wrinkled! 
I paid almost $80/each for 2 sets and am extremely disappointed. I would have returned them if I could've found something that would fit our good-sized mattress.
Don't waste your money. You may as well buy the 200 count sheet sets in the little fabric bags, they're softer and more comfortable than these...especially after washing.",1.0,-1
"I am a huge fan of nice, crisp white sheets.  These are exactly that.  Out of the package, they seemed very soft.  I washed and dried them immediately.  They were VERY wrinkled when I removed from dryer and I used fabric softener and a dryer sheet.   I still like the sheets.  The fitted sheet has a wide elastic band all the way around making it easier to make and to stay on the mattress.",4.0,-1
"Very disappointed in this product.  The material was stiff, even after I washed it.  I've had this product for one month and washed it a few times.  The colors ran and look noticeably faded in certain areas.  The fit was fine for a queen sized bed. Would not recommend this product.",1.0,-1
"I was very disappointed in these sheets they are very rough and do not get better with  washing.  I thought with the high thread count they would be soft.  They are not.

I do however like the deep pockets and the way they stay on the mattress till washing.  TOO ROUGH TOO HOT.",2.0,-1
Splurged for the more expensive 600 TC.  Washed them before putting on the bed.  They came out of the dryer horribly wrinkled and almost paper stiff.

"If I could give these sheets NO stars, I would.  They are in the washer for the 4th time.  they are so rough and scratchy that I had to get up in the middle of the night to change them off of the bed and once again, see if washing/drying will soften them enough to sleep on.",1.0,-1

"Ok. I was a little dissatisfied at first. The very first wash yielded a scratchy sheet... I loved the way the fit the bed and how heavy they are! They are sheets that are made to last. However, I do agree that at first they are a little scratchy. However, I have washed my sheets 3 times now and I put in about a 1/2 cup of baking soda with the soap and softener. They are softening up very nice. 100% cotton sheets take time to get soft people! The are NOT A BLEND! If you want instantly soft sheets out of the pack, get yourself a sateen blend sheet or a microfiber but those will not stand the test of time. These sheets will last years and be softer with every wash. Give them a fair chance.",4.0,-1
"I got the 600 thread luxury cotton sheets to try out and compare them to the bamboo sheets I’ve had.

"My wife has always been pleased with bedding from Walmart.  The less expensive pillowcases come out of the dryer wrinkle free.   Yesterday I convinced her to buy these 600 thread pillowcases which came out of the dryer nothing but wrinkles!

The card surrounding the pillowcases states:   ""Care Instructions:  Machine wash, see care label.""   In minute type, deep within the pillowcase, is the care label which directs: "" Iron on medium heat when needed.""   Unless you're someone who still owns and enjoys using an iron, stay away from this brand!",1.0,-1
They fit my Queen size bed great. The fitted sheet is really great and labeled to see top or bottom. Nice move. I usually use a marker to show T or B so I don't go crazy trying to fit them. Just me. The sheets are very nice. They do get softer after a few washes. I have the  gold ones and holding up well and they are comfortable. Just bought the gray patterned ones. A nice product that is made in India and seems to me to hold up for a long time ahead. I like these very much. Well made product.,4.0,-1
"These sheets are FABULOUS.  It's been so long since I had a GREAT set of sheets, I am amazed.  The fabric is thick and very substantial.  I like a crisp sheet and these aren't quite as crisp as the old fashioned sheets, but  they are even better.  They are so comfortable and make you feel cozy/relaxed.  I can't say enough about them.

"These sheets are very good quality.  I don't know if they were intentionally branded this way or it's my subconscious, but they do remind me of sheets used in hotel rooms.

I purchased the ""clay beige"" online, and was happy to find they were not quite as orangey as the photograph indicated.  It's a bold neutral.  I don't have an especially deep mattress, which these are apparently designed for, but they fit pretty well and the simple stitching detail adds a nice design aesthetic.

Most sheets donât go completely strong the mattress and have a lot if extra fabric making the loose  ( how itâs possible to not for AND Be loose is brings me). These sheets completely cover the mattress, are plenty deep enough and do not have bulky extras on the top . Must have for King bed owners",5.0,-1
"These are beautiful sheets. I have the puddle blue and the teal print. I actually like the puddle blue ones a bit more but they are both beautiful high quality soft cotton sheets. The pockets are deep, the tailoring is perfect, the material is substantial enough and they do not pill. They are perfect and the price is great for this quality.",5.0,-1
"(For reference I purchased in store) First off, the sheet set DOES NOT match the pillowcase set. Second, the wrinkles are insane and impossible to get rid of unless you want to iron them everyday after each use. Third, don't purchase these at all, not worth the price and quality isn't any better than the cheap Mainstays Walmart brand. I returned these and bought the exact same color (soft silver) in the Better Home and Gardens brand. WAY BETTER, half the cost, same quality, and best part wrinkle free (after a wash or two)",1.0,-1
"If you are in need of a good night's sleep,  invest in these sheets! I slept like a baby on these 600 thred count sheets,  you can feel the quality.

I have purchased sheets from Walmart for many years.  The style I usually buy is always out of stock so chose these.  They feel nice before washing but stiff after and very wrinkled.  I will try several more washes but am disappointed with the wrinkles.,3.0,-1
"These are the best sheets I have ever owned. Soft and Luxurious, they feel marvelous. I bought Teal Paisley and almost wish I didn't have to cover them with a bedspread. They fit the mattress perfectly and stay put. I have washed them twice and no pilling, almost no wrinkles, and no shrinking. Great buy that will last me for years.",5.0,-1
"I bought my first set a couple of months ago and was amazed at the comfort! The sheets were so soft. I loved the elastic which made the fitted sheet fit better than most. We then bought a thicker mattress and since this is a deep pocket style, we decided to replace an old small set with another new Hotel Style set.  Because we loved the first one so much, we went to Walmart and purchased an identical set in blue.  I am so disappointed that these sheets are not soft, but rather rough and very wrinkled (I washed them). The fit is still very good, but the finish is not the same. I would hesitate to buy any more at this price.",3.0,-1
"These sheets are very scratchy.  I thought since they were 600 thread count, they would be soft.  When I took them out of the dryer, I thought they felt scratchy, but I hoped that once they were on the bed, they would be softer.  I paid $50 for a full sized set and that's a lot of money for me to spend on sheets.  I thought the 600 thread count would make it worth it.  I've bought BHG sheets in the past and will go back to them.  They're much, much softer and nicer to sleep on.",1.0,-1
I love these sheets. They aren't Egyptian cotton but they are very nice and durable. They are real quality. I love how deep the pockets are on these. This is my second set. I bought one set and came back for more. It takes a few washes for them to soften up. But well worth it,5.0,-1
I am very pleased with these sheets. The top sheet is longer than the lower priced sheet so it stays tucked. I also like that the elastic runs around the entire sheet making it fit better. I usually don't buy the more expensive sheets but these were definitely worth it.,5.0,-1
These might be the best sheets I have ever bought. (And I've been buying sheets for years). They are 100% cotton and have a solid texture to them - unlike cotton/synthetic blends. And they washed beautifully. I bought the  Cream Mist shade which is a little bit deeper than Ivory. Although the color blends with everything I plan to buy another set in a different color. They are perfect!,5.0,-1

"I can't say enough good things about these. They're extremely soft. The most impressive part is the true grip technology. In 2 years, our fitted sheet has never come off our mattress. It's amazing! They're for very thick mattresses. We have a very thick pillowtop matress and added a 2"" gel, memory foam mattress on top of it. It's still a little big. It fits up to 20"" deep matresses! I promise, they're worth the price! They wash and dry well also.",5.0,-1
"These sheets, or maybe I should specify the culprit as being the elastic band on the fitted sheet, shrunk IMMEDIATELY. I'm very careful with the way I wash my sheets, always making sure to wash them in warm or cold water. By the time we were ready for a second wash, the sheet came out with the elastic band being ridiculously tight. I tried it on my mattress, but all I could here from the straining was the sound of fabric popping/ripping. For the price, I didn't expect this. I'll know better next time.",1.0,-1
"These are just ok.  ""Luminous cotton sateen weave"" and ""silky-soft feel"" is what I was wanting but instead I feel these are crispy, a bit scratchy feeling-even after several washes.  I'm happy with the Cream Paisley print and coloring.  These also fit our mattress perfect.  We have an 11"" adjustable mattress with a 4"" memory foam topper so the fitted sheet stays put with the help of some elastic straps/clips also brought at Walmart.  That deep pocket passed the test, I just wish the fabric was more silky feeling.",3.0,-1

"The hotel style 600 thread count luxury cotton bedding is super comfortable. Me and my husband are really impressed. There great fit and it's way better than my current sheets.

Amazing luxuriois sheets. Worth the price. I bought these to replace cheap microfiber ones. These are awesome and cooling not hot like the microfiber and have a much more expensive feel.

I cant imagine anyone no loving these as I am very picky with my bedding.,5.0,-1
"Yes, these are definitely “hotel style” sheets as they are really nice!  After washing the feel is soft and cottony with a nice “sheen” to feel good on your skin. The deep and reinforced pockets on the fitted sheet are so genius- it fits the mattress nice and snug with NO chance of it coming off. The only thing I don’t live about these is the color. I thought they would be more gold-like but instead found them to be more brown. Overall though this is a nice quality sheet set. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",4.0,-1
"These aheets are good quality, however they are very wrinkly. I can do a low spin cycle , dry them alone with dryer balls, and pull them put as soon as the dryer is done and they are still a wrinkled mess. They are however to my standards on softness and the color is nice. They fit our king bed well and fitted sheet stays secure with think elastic. All in all, they are too expensive to always look this wrinkled on the bed, and I am not about to iron bed sheets.",3.0,-1
"These are 600 count Egyptian cotton sheets. They wash wonderfully,  are soft and feel great. The all around wide elastic on bottom sheet keeps it snuggly in place, on my extra thick king size mattress. I believe it would fit a 20 inch mattress beautifully. The top sheet has plenty of overhang, there is no fighting over the sheet. I went right out and bought a second set. Well worth the money",5.0,-1
"I have been really satisfied with these sheets, they are crisp but feel fairly soft. I'm still looking for something that has this quality in a thicker sheet. I've researched over and over and have decided that 100% Sateen Cotton is the way to go. I have found several sheets that are soft, but thin and won't stay in place and the 100% Cotton are suitable for any kind of weather. All in all, I would buy these brands of sheets again, but I think I'll get the higher thread count.",5.0,-1
"I bought these sheets in the store. My dog scratched a hole in our good set and I needed a quick replacement. This was the only set our local walmart had in deep pockets, so I bought them. The sheets are as advertised, deep pockets. They fit our mattress well, where we've had trouble finding sheets long enough and the pocket size deep enough. With that being said, these sheets are very scratchy. Granted I went from sheets that were a high cotton quality to these. It wasn't a horrible night sleep, and I'm sure I'll get used to it, but I've certainly felt softer sheets with 600 thread count. I probably won't buy these sheets again.",3.0,-1
"I was very impressed with this sheet set.  The fabric is of excellent quality, and seems quite dense.  The sewing and assembly appears to be nearly flawless.  It also has very deep pockets.

I bought these sheets for my new king size bed. They are pretty but once washed were so wrinkled I hate to get into bed.

Felt soft prior to wash, but after wash there seems to be a bit of roughness to the sheet.   I didn't find them uncomfortable to sleep on, but just not the kind of sheet you want to rub all over your naked body.  Quality = 5 stars, softness = 2 stars. Average = 3.",3.0,-1

"When I bought the first set of these sheets I actually couldn't believe the quality.  You have to try a set to understand what I'm talking about. They fit really nice and accommodate for thick mattresses. They have wide elastic around the whole sheet which works for a great fit all the time. After a wash they go back on like a new set of sheets. There's no pilling or thinning or anything you get from cheap sheets. I bought a second set and for Christmas I sent a set to my daughter and she absolutely loves them. Try a set and see if you don't end up giving a great review, just like me.",5.0,-1
I bought the 1000 count first.  These are the best sheets I have ever had. They are soft and they fit so well. Easy to put on he fitted sheets without it being a challenge.  The elastic on the corners is a wide elastic and stretchy.  They wash well. I bought a second set in 600 count to compare.  Very nice but not quite as nice. I only wish there were more color options left. I would buy more but how many sheet sets does a person need?,5.0,-1
"These are my favorite sheets to purchase and they're silky soft against the skin! These sheets are perfect for pillow top mattresses and memory foam tops they fit up to 20"". the corners of the fitted sheet have elastic so it fits perfectly on any size matress.

Also as a bonus they have a tag at the top and bottom of the king size so it's easy to tell which way they go on!",5.0,-1
"I usually dont buy any less than 1000 thread count but we liked the pattern in these and thought we would try them as thry are cheaply priced.

"Pretty amazed by the reviews here! I am so incredibly let down by these sheets. We bought them because I am 8 moths pregnant with heightened skin sensitivity- these had the highest thread count in store, which I thought would mean they would be the softest. Dead wrong! These are so scratchy and rough on my skin that I cannot sleep on them, or I spend the entire night itching. No amount of fabric softener helps the texture. My man is also not impressed with the quality, but being that we are $100 into these sheets with a baby around the corner, we feel stuck with them, making this the most regrettable purchase we've made in quite some time, and frankly making me more miserable during the most uncomfortable time of my life.

These sheets are a great value.  This is the 3rd set I have purchased.  The elastic on the fitted sheet is excellent and it has a very deep pocket.  The cotton is soft but sturdy and not too thin.  I am particular about sheets and I have paid a lot of money for sheets thinking that I would get better quality.  That is not always true.  I stumbled upon these sheets when I arrived at our summer house late one evening and realized that we had taken our sheets home to wash and forgotten to pack them.

"If I could rate a ZERO I would. These sheets were recommended by friend. I bought them, took them out of the package, and was very surprised at the scratchy samdpaper feel.  Iâm now repeatedly washing them and hoping for the best. I donât know if I got a bad set or what",1.0,-1
Very comfortable I loved them I bought 2 king sets. Fitted sheet always stayed on all night. After a few washes I noticed one had small holes after a few more other set same thing then they just ripped out like fabric was rotten I never had sheets tear up on bed in less than a years service. And was alternating uses. Will not buy again but everything else I loved.  Shame,1.0,-1
"My Husband and I have been looking for a new set of sheets for many weeks and found this set a our local WalMart.  We love the sheets.  I am not one that likes a soft and frilly sheet...I love a crisp set of sheets.  I washed the sheets in warm water and dried on a medium to hot dryer before putting them on the bed.  They turned out magnificent.  The pockets are deep enough to fit our 18 inch mattress and we love the all around elastic...makes the sheet fit better.  The top sheet is extra long, makes it stay in place much better.  In the past we have purchased sheets at Macy's and JC Penney and paid a rather high price for sheets.  This set was less than $60.00...600 thread count and we are loving them!  Glad our local WalMart carries sheets that we will purchase and not have to go miles away from our home to the large malls to get what we need and want!",5.0,-1
"The sheets feel amazing to sleep on, cool to the touch and smooth as silk.  feels like luxury to sleep on....however, 5 months into my purchase (3.5 months counting when it first started), there are several thread bare spots that will eventually become full blown holes very soon.  60 bucks worth of sheets should last more than 5 months. I can't find anything with a number or email to call for replacement.",3.0,-1
"I bought these to replace my 400 thread home and graden set which by the way are probably one of the best sheet sets I've ever owned. But the 600 thread was rough 
no sliky-ness to them at all definitely not worth the $70. Quality just isn't there. Maybe i purchased a bad set or something ill be returning them shortly",1.0,-1
"We bought a pair of these sheets 1 year ago! I loved them so much. It was like sleeping ob butter. My husband accidently tore the botton sheet so i had him go buy anorher set. We bought the exact same pattern and everything. These sheets feel like cardboard. They are worse than $20 promo special sheets. At first i thought maybe my skin was dry from winter so i went and put lotion on, nope. then i thought maybe they just need to be washed with fabric softener, nope. Still cardboard. I hadnt said a word to my husband because he suprised me with the new set but today he asked if the sheets were scratchy and i told him yes!!! I thought i was going crazy. I will not buy this brand again. They obviously have a quality control issue. I want to know when i buy something from a brand that im getting quality. This was not quality.",1.0,-1

"This set is exactly what I needed to bring the edge back to my decades old Henckels. I needed larger sharpening stones for my kitchen knives, versus the smaller stones I use for my pocket knives, and this set doesn't dissapoint.  I purchased the 10,000 grit stone as well (highly recommended), and the results are exactly as expected...a straight, razor sharp, mirror finished edge (need to 10,000 to get the best mirror finish).  The included DVD is helpful regarding the use of these particular stones, which are synthetic. I especially like the sink bridge idea, and quickly found that I throughly enjoy the convenience.  I actually leave the water on a very, very low trickle while sharpening and work the stone and knife while quickly clearing the stone of particulates. The trick is keeping a consistent angle over the entire edge, but practice make perfect, and as the video recommends, ""incorporate blade touchup as part of your daily cleanup.""  Needless to say, you can't go wrong with this set.  Well worth the money.",5.0,1

Bob Kramer is the expert on knives, so it's very helpful to get a video from him on how to use the stones.",5.0,-1
Great product. Very well made with high quality materials. It will take some practice to be proficient at sharpening. It's hard to get the correct angle for a super sharp result. I find myself dulling the knife more times and having to start over.,4.0,-1
My husband found a Bob Kramer video online using this whetstone set and was intriqued.  I purchased it for his birthday.  He is working on mastering the technique. His father uses a whetstone as well so they've enjoyed helping each other.  He finds its putting an incredible edge back on his blades and therapeutic at the same time.,4.0,-1
"the sharpening stones and the material that the holder is made from could rate 5 stars, but the adjustable bolt/ wingnut hardware used is inadequate to hold the stones securely or to set or hold an adjustment when over a sink.  with a little re-engineering and a hardware upgrade, it should be quite useful.",3.0,-1
"This sharpening kit has 3 wet stones of varying grit for all your needs.  I like the over the sink base, its adjustable and does not move when sharpening.  Once you get the hang of wet stoning you'll never go back to any other way of sharpening.  Tip - practice on old knives not new ones and watch a U Tube video for guidance.",4.0,-1
"Just like his knives, this sharpening stone has it all.

Takes practice, but the results are so much better than using any other sharpening tool. If you have nice knives, Japanese or Western, definitely go the wet stone route for sharpening.",5.0,-1
"If you have Kramer knives at home, this sharpening set is so necessary to maintain the edge, angle and beauty of the blades. This set makes it easy (and a little tedious) to sharpen and restore the strong carbon steel of a Kramer knife.

"This set takes a little while to get the hang of, but once you do, you'll never go back to sharpening knives any other way! I am so impressed at the beauty of this set and the wooden holder for the water stone makes for a very stable sharpening base.",5.0,-1
If you are going to invest in quality cutlery you should also invest in the right tools to maintain them. This kit has it all. The synthetic stones dont need to be presoaked so that saves time and planning. The stones are wide so you can cover more of the blade in an easy stroke. I love the sink bridge. Sharpening under the running water is so much neater than on the countertop. The instructional videos really break down the how and why of sharpening.,5.0,-1
"I ordered this set since My knife store is closed due to covid. it arrived yesterday and after watching the video today and getting the feel of the bridge, I am ready to start learning how to sharpen my own knives!

This is the real deal. Everything you need to maintain your knives like a true bladesmith. This isn't a tool for everyone; but it is if you love having and using quality.

I have learned using the whetstone method is an art, and it does take some practice, but it's well worth your time.",5.0,-1

"We ordered the Cadet Grey - Right sectional. The sofa is perfect! Very modern looking. It came it two pieces. The sectional pieces do not latch/connect together. We don't have any problem with that but some people may. The color is true to the listing. While we strongly recommend this sofa to everyone, we highly recommend not purchasing it through Hayneedle. A few days after purchasing the sectional, we received an email that it was backordered (mind you, the listing gave no indication that this was the case). It would be an extra month or so until we got it. We decided to stay the course as we loved the design and look of it. About a week later we received an email that the sofa had shipped (about 2.5 weeks earlier than expected). Surprised, we emailed Hayneedle customer service and asked them to verify this. They replied that there was a mistake and issued us a new order number. Eventually the sofa shipped on the projected backorder date. We also purchased the ""white glove"" service which included them delivering it to the room of our choosing in our apartment. We scheduled delivery for a Monday from 1pm to 5pm. I left work in order to be home to receive the sofa. Around 4pm I received a call that there was a mistake and my new time was the next day from 10am to 2pm. Again, I took off work to be home. The delivery man arrived and told me that he was only instructed to drop off the sofa and leave (we live on the 6th floor of an apartment building in downtown Denver...). He offered to let me speak with his manager, who told me that Hayneedle contracts them specifically to drop off and leave; this specific delivery company does not do any ""white glove"" service. Having gone through all of this, we opted to have him leave the sofa and take it up ourselves so that we could finally have somewhere to sit. I am HIGHLY disappointed in Hayneedle's customer service with this order and will have to think long and hard before giving them my business again.",1.0,1

I was surprised that it was able to cover the entire chair. It fits well, no gaping and comes down far enough on the chair to cover all of the original fabric.

"The previous owners of the home I bought had installed cheap black outdoor lamps and since one out of five was broken, I decided they all needed to be replaced ASAP. I found these lights at Lamps Plus and decided they would look really good with the style of my home, and I was right...they look great! See my before and after pics!! They were easy to install and my daughter and I hung all five in about two hours. My one comment would be that because the seeded glass is clear, you will need to find LED bulbs that are all-glass rather than the ones with the insulator covering the top third of the bulb. And there is additional good news: dead bugs cannot collect as the bottom is open, and bulbs can be changed through that bottom without taking the light apart!
As I said, these lights are just what I was looking for!

"I bought this for my 14 month old and absolutely love it! I wanted something his size to sit in that he could also play a bit on. Marshmallow couches are just foam and $35, so the $56 price was great considering. It's sturdier than I expected. I'm 140 lbs and I've sat on it for a few moments (I couldn't resist) and it didn't bend or creak. My son loves to crawl over it and kind of hangs off the sides and it doesn't tip over. Only if he hangs way over the back will it tip. The fabric is perfect to wipe off dried on food as it's bound to happen with little ones. I just take a wet wipe to whatever is stuck on, and it comes right off. I love the way it looks. It's just so stinking cute! Much better to look at than an ugly cartoon foam couch. And little ones look so sweet sitting on it. We haven't had it very long yet, but it seems to be built well enough to last a while. So happy I bought this.",5.0,-1
"I bought 2 of these lamps for my front porch.  The old ones on my porch required some rather annoying DISASSEMBLY to replace a light bulb - not the case with these!  I love how easy it is to just reach under and change-away...  (Although a few months later, I discovered the benefits of using the compact flourescent bulbs and haven't really had a need to change them often.  Those bulbs cast a nice white light that is not too bright.)  Love the seed glass - very artistic and distinctive.

"I never used to be a fan of Keurig in fact I thought they were stupid, when I drink coffee I drink a few cups at a sitting so the thought of a machine that specialized at making one cup at a time seemed ridiculous to me.  Then some friends were going on a trip and asked my wife and I if we could stay at their house and watch their dogs while they were gone. These friends had a Keurig and a bunch of different coffee and said we could help ourselves to whatever we wanted.  So over the next week I got used to the Keurig and the quality of coffee it made; I got so used to it in fact that the week after our friends came back from their trip I bought my Keurig. My attitude toward Keurig has completely changed I love it, with a good coffee like Starbucks or Caribou you can make coffee shop grade coffee at home something my old machine couldn't do.  I used a French press for a while too, that made good quality coffee but it took so long to heat the water and clean it out when you were done. The Keurig is fast and easy to use makes great coffee every time.  The only thing I wish Keurig would do is make reusable mug and Carafe pods for when you want more than a standard sized cup or a few cups,  the selection of mug and carafe pods that are available sucks.",5.0,1

"just bought a violet K.02 so much fun! very happy with my Keurig. maintenance is easy, doughnut house pods are my favorite, dark chocolate. Had a problem with chocolate, solved it by using just the hot water, cut the pod open and pour into the hot water.  Don't waste coffee and no messy coffee grounds. BTW gave the black coffee maker to my grand daughter.",5.0,1
"The system offers the ability to brew a 4, 6, 8, or 10 ounce cup. If choose 10 ounce and the majority of the time get 4 ounces. I choose 4 ounces and get anywhere from 2 to 10 ounces all at once. The computer system does not distribute the water measurements correctly and has caused much frustration. I will never buy a Keurig again!",1.0,1
Very disappointed in the Kuerig 2.0. This is the second one I have bought in 6 months. The first one would not brew a cup of coffee after inserting the pod. Brought it back and continued to use an older Kuerig model ( which I have loved for the pas 8 yrs)which no longer drips water. I bought a second Kuerig and it has an awful plastic taste that will not go away. I have read many reviews and find this is quite common with the 2.0. I also find the 2.0 version very cheaply made compared to the older models. Very disappointed and sad to say I will no longer be a Kuerig user. Making coffee shouldn't be this much of a hassle.,1.0,1
"I BOUGHT THIS TO REPLACE MY HOME COFFE MAKER (HAMILTON BEECH), THAT MADE LOUSY COFFEE. I HAVE A KEURIG 1.0 IN MY OFFICE THAT USES A REFILLABLE K-CUP W/ AN ADAPTER. THE NEW UNIT (2.0) WILL ONLY WORK W/ KEURIG K-CUPS AND KEURIG DOES NOT MAKE A REFILLABLE K-CUP FOR THE 2.0 SYSTEM AT THIS TIME. I RESOVED ALL PROBLEMS BY PEELING OFF A FRESHLEY BREWED KEURIG K-CUP TOP ( THE HEAT RELEASED THE GLUE ON THE CUP TOP) AND PLACED IT PRINTED SIDE UP ON PAKING TAPE (STICKY SIDE UP) THEN TAPED THAT TAPE WITH PRINTED SIDE UP TO MY REFILLABLE TOP. I THEN INSERTED THE REFILLABLE K-CUP IN THE THE 2.0 UNIT, CLOSED THE TOP, THEN OPENED THE UNIT AND PRESSED THE EXPOSED TAPE ON TO THE EXPOSED BOTTOM OF LID (CLOSING MECHINISM). IT WOKED FINE BUT DID NOT HAVE THE FULL MENU.!!!! TO FIX THAT, I USED A SMALL 1/32 SCALE SLOT CAR MAGNET AND PLACED IT ON THE BOTTOM EDGE OF THE K-CUP INSERT HOLDER. IT HOLDS MAGNETICALLY IN A VERTICLE POSITION AUTOMACTICALLY. VIOLA!!!!!! I NOW HAVE FULL MENU AND CARAFE CAPABILITY AND AM USING MY AFTER MARKET REFILLABLE K-CUP!!! SHAME ON YOU KEURIG!!!!!!!! FOR GETTING GREEDY ABOUT YOUR COFFEE SALES!!! TO RE-DESIGN A QUALITY COFFEE MAKER THAT WILL NOT ALLOW THE CUSTOMER TO USE THE COFFEE OF HIS CHOICE IS UNCONSCIENABLE AND DOWN RIGHT WRONG!!!!

"Like so many other Keurigs, mine worked for a few months, then started only pumping a fraction of a cup. Did all the usual things that customer service suggests...ran cleaner through it multiple times, cleaned the needle (which wasn't plugged), etc. It finally stopped working altogether. Called Keurig and was told they would send me a new brewer...at a small discount. No thanks. The problem with a Keurig is the pump. It malfunctions. So for all those who post reviews like ""I love it!"", come back in a few months and let us know if you still love it. That's the problem with most reviewers. they don't wait and see how long the product lasts.",1.0,1

"The sleek style of this Keurig is very appealing. I am a frequent coffee drinker, and have no desire to use any other brand of coffee other than Keurig brands (the kcup offers all I want, while larger size cups are extremely limited). My issue is that I like to brew more than 10oz with one Kcup. The 2.0 K200 brewer I recently purchased limits the amount you can brew without changing to a different pod, and therefor, it doesn't suit my taste like the single-serve mini that I previously used for the past 2 yrs. Even after cleaning and running water through several times, I get a plastic taste on top of the limited ounces. If I can't get this resolved, I won't be using this system anymore.",3.0,1

May as well use my Mr. Coffee that brews by the pot, cost less than $15 and is over 5 years old.",2.0,1
"I genuinely love this product, not only is it way better than any other coffee maker or tea kettle, it's beautiful looking. It has a touch screen and step by step display. Also, you can program it to have a cup or carafe of your favorite coffee or tea waiting on you in the morning, afternoon, or evening. But you can also tell it it what kind of brew you want. It gives an option for a ""strong brew"", for those of you that like coffee that feels like a good morning slap in the face. What makes it special is, it's just so incredibly easy to you. It has a detachable water dispenser, so you doing have to play, try not to get a electrocuted. But it's good for any household, because each individual person, can have their favorite cup of coffee in under 3 minutes. It's good for someone on the go, or someone who likes to have their beverages at their leisure. But with an, 'on the go' brewing speed. I've always wanted one, I've always wondered if it was all it was cracked up to be? It totally is. Why spend close to the same amount on something basic, when you can have something special. Keurig 2.0 is definitely special. And now that I use the K-Pods, I do see them in more and more grocery stores. So you don't HAVE to order everything online, but you can if you wanted to.",5.0,1
"After 4 tries I finally received a brewer that works. Originally it was called the K250 and they changed the name to the K200. Due to the change they no longer give you the free coffee samples which is fine. It took them 4 months to finally get me the correct water filter kit. With this order I received a water filter but they left out the 2 free cartridges and they left out the descaling solution. As far as I'm concerned when you replace something it should be the entire kit as advertised. Also when I registered this brewer I was told I would receive another email with a coupon good for 2 boxes of coffee when you purchase 2 boxes with free shipping which they didn'tdo. The first brewer didn't have the water filter kit and it took them 4 months to get one by them sending me a second brewer replacement kit. This second one was missing the drp tray so I had to keep the original from the first brewer. The 2nd brewer also had a crack in the plastic resorvior so I had to keep the one that came with the first brewer. So then they sent me a third brwer but they were out of the black and I wasn't told that was just temporary so I had to pick another color which was hidious if you're a guy. 2 days later when I wrote the review I received a call saying they could send the black one and this one works but my opinion is whether it's a replacement or not, everything that is supposed to come with the K250(K200) should still come with it. Last of all when I registered this brewer I was told specifically by the representative I would receive a coupon good for 2 free boxes of coffee when you purchase 2 by email even though it was a replacement. This did not happen at all. If you're going to purchase a brewer by Keurig don't believe everything they tell or promise you.",3.0,1
"I've owned A Keurig coffee maker for several years now. I decided to buy the K200 and found out Keurig has now added a sensor that will only allow it to use the Keurig brand k-cups.

I loved my previous Keurig and was excited to get this one for Christmas. What a disappointment to find out I have an entire drawer full of flavored coffee's (sorry Keurig, not your brand) that won't work. Will never buy another Keurig again and have posted to my FB for all my friends to not buy one either for this reason.",1.0,1
"Noisy, difficult to fill the tank (tank will not clear my upper kitchen cabinets if I try to remove), condensation drips everywhere when you remove lid to tank, on strong setting it spews coffee grounds every where, can use only Keurig brand cup (which is not the best coffee in the world), packaging is misleading - thought I would be able to brew 5 different sizes but not without using a different size K-cup which don't seem to be available anywhere.  Brewer is so light weight that when you lift the handle to insert the pod the whole coffee maker lifts up.  Tank is too small.  Only purchased this coffee brewer because I wanted a white one to coordinate with my kitchen.  Too expensive for how cheaply made it seems to be.  Prices of this model have dropped at local retailers.",1.0,1
I have had keurig coffee makers for years only order my coffee pods from keurig put this coffee maker i do not like seems every 10 cups of coffee you have to use that thing that comes with it cause i get nothing but coffee grounds and it tells you to do this.

"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my husband, to replace a Keurig Mini that has been positively plagued by problems with grounds continually clogging the needle, etc. It's so disappointing to see in other reviews that while this is a new and improved product, the malfunction continues to be a recurring problem. But the biggest reason that I am returning this machine without giving it to my husband is the restriction on which coffee pods can be used in the machine. We like to use Dunkin coffee, among others. Though this restriction on Keurig's part is a classic capitalist move, it just seems downright unAmerican. It's laughable to see Keurig respond to complaints about this limitation with the comment, ""We're sorry to hear you have k-cup pods that will not brew in your new 2.0 K250. "" They're sorry to hear it? It's exactly what they wanted. They designed it that way. Sorry, but I just can't support that kind of corporate malfeasance.",1.0,1

Keurig wouldn't replace - instead sent a ""cleaning kit"" which was useless. Husband is furious that it requires putting K-cup in and out anywhere from 5 to 10 times before machine will read. Isn't worth the aggravation and wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy. It's a shame - we loved our original Keurig which gave out from constant use.",1.0,1

It was suggested that I unplug the unit to reset the screen. That's a great suggestion that I crawl under my desk to unplug it every time I want to use this product. Third, it only goes to 10 oz when I can get the screen to work. If i want the standard 12 oz size I have to spend even more money.",1.0,1

So I need to do this monthly but if that is all I have to do and it keeps on brewing like it does its a small price to pay. So far a much improved model compared to the first one. The screen is easy to use to make your size and strength selection and the big flashing button to brew couldn't be easier. Quick and easy clean up and have not run into any issues with odd brands not working. If find some brands are not maybe up to the same standards as others. I like 8 o'clock Italian Roast but the foil top gets rips and enlarged during use and causes grounds to plug up the works (ergo the cleaning) but since I switched to another brand I don't have that problem. We just ordered a K350 to replace the old B45 in the kitchen.",4.0,1

"I use my Keurig 2.0 EVERYDAY! and always wandered when I place a store bought K-cup or even my own K-cup I only have 3 choices in ounces. It always starts with 8 oz and then I can select the other ounces which are 6 oz & 4 oz. This upsets me because I have a favorite coffee mug which is kind of big, so when I select the only big ounce size (8 oz) when I look in my cup I feel like I have to repeat step 1 again. Then I went on Keurig's website and it says for the 2.0 it has more than 3 settings?? is my Keurig 2.0 broke or something? I plan on buying the carafe but sometimes I just want one big cup of coffee. Can somebody from the Keurig Corp. tell me why I only have 3 different ounce settings? maybe something needs to be replaced? Thank You!",4.0,1

"I'd been wanting for a while. A long while. Finally Black Friday I bought this thing. (First Black Friday purchase ever, too!) I got the Strawberry, and it's adorable. I'd heard people complain it stays on all the time, and then complain that it has to keep ""preheating"" ... well, if it stays on all the time it doesn't. LOL I have not had a single messed up pod, and my mom had some old ones she'd gotten as samples - and they worked. The only oops message we got was when my son didn't close it all the way. I originally wanted the bigger unit, but I bought this one because 1. it was on incredible sale, and 2. I wanted Strawberry. My initial thoughts were ""Well, I don't drink THAT much coffee and the smaller reservoir won't be that big a problem ... besides all I'd really be upgrading for would be a color screen and color changing light in the reservoir ........ right?"" I was wrong. Cracks me up how often we're refilling the thing. But that just shows how much we love it. It's getting a big workout. Bottom line: Keurig, where have you been all my life?",5.0,1
I purchased this chopper a few weeks ago based on a friend's recommendation. Game changer!  Chops and purées well. So easy to use and clean. Also it's small enough to stay out on the countertop.

By far the one of the worst purchases made!  This is my 3rd Keurig now (3rd unit being a warranty replacement).  1st old style unite was great but both 2.0 units pop the internal filter in k-cups and brew a cup full of grounds.  Such a waste of money.  Would not recommend buying.  Next unit will be a Ninja coffee bar.  Same features without the hassle,1.0,1

"We had the original Keurig and loved it until it finally died. We purchased the 2.0 and have been so disappointed. It feels like we've regressed instead of making it better.

Took it back and exchanged ut but had the same problem immediately. This time we called Kuerig and they agreed to replace the pot. We received the new pot todat (our 3rd) and we still get grinds. Called customer service and they are sending us another pot (#4) however i would prefer a refund but since we didnt but it from their website they cannot give us a refund.

I really like the amount of cup sizes you can brew. I was also pleased that I could fit just about every size of mug under the brewer. Once the water was heated, it brewed coffee very quickly. The only issues I really had with the brewer was you are limited to Keurig K-cups. While there are a lot out there, that definitely limits the cups you can use. Also, while you can brew a carafe, you have to buy it separately. Overall, I am very pleased with the new 2.0 k250 brewer!",4.0,1

We called customer support, went through some tests, and then they sent us new one. We received the new one and within the first or second brew, we had grounds! We went through tests again and to no avail. We asked customer support to send us a different and upgraded Keurig - which they did, and we are within a week of that one. So far, so great. That said, there must be some type of defect with this type of Keurig. I can't imagine we received the two totally odd ones in a batch.",1.0,1

"Very disappointed with my new 2.0 Brewer. Coffee grinds kept getting into my coffee and the water temp wasn't hot enough. When making tea I could only chose from 4oz or 6oz of water. So I had to brew twice just to get a 8oz cup of tea. My old k-pods with the keruig stamp on them still wouldn't work in this new model. So I wasted about 3 boxes of coffee trying to make them work. I guess I should have stopped while I was ahead, but I told that the old pods would work. Last but not least, who likes to tastes coffee grinds in your coffee? But I must admit that the customer service at Keruig was very nice about my problems and offer to replace the unit at no cost to me, but I decided to return it back to the retail store and pulled the old keruig out of retirement.",1.0,1

I've enclosed a picture of the 2 models below. Could anyone let me know the difference between these 2 models and also which one is the newest and latest model? Thanks a lot for your help.

I purchased this for my boyfriend for christmas. I've used my mom's keurig (another older model) and loved it. She used her own coffee rather than the pods and it always tasted perfect. I purchased the my kcup and carafe to go along with the brewer. Unfortunately no matter what I've tried I can't manage to get a strong cup of coffee out of the my kcup. I can't speak for the regular pods as we haven't used these and never intended to. Is there a trick I don't know about? I've searched the internet and discovered many other people have had the same issue. It's a real bummer and I guess I'm just going to have to give in and buy regular pods. Its a shame. I really want to have the freedom to use whatever coffee I want. My sister got us some specialty coffee from a roaster in dallas and I can't even get a proper brew from it. It literally looks like tea no matter what I do. I've adjusted the grind and made sure not to over pack the filter. Nothing works. Just be warned if you were thinking of using this for your own coffee. You will be very disappointed.,2.0,1
I have been in love with this little chopper from kitchenaid. I love to make dressings in it and it makes hummus and pesto so easily! They clean up is a breeze! I would definitely recommend getting one for your chef in the house [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],5.0,-1
"When it recognizes the pods, brews good tea/coffee... problem is IF. Does not recognize the carafe I bought even though it's made by Keurig and does not recognize most of the pods, even though they worked fine in my original Keurig brewer. So, unless you have tea bags for hot water which this dispenses well, save your money!",2.0,1

"I have owned (and still own) several different Keurig brewers. I bought the K250 for a holiday home I was visiting. It was perfect for making our morning coffee and I didn't miss the larger reservoir or the extra features of the higher level brewers at all. If you kitchen counter space is limited, this might be better for you than the larger and mor full featured brewers and the mini plus (which has no reservoir)",5.0,1
"I got this small food processor because I have never owned one any size. Gracious, this baby comes in handy for so many unexpected things. I know know the mains and use it for those but wow it’s elevated to my favorite kitchen appliance! So many uses and for one person, my husband passed away and my son went to college and on..., and it’s just perfect. The pink color was my personal touch and it fits elegantly. Thanks Kitchenaid!

"I am on my second K 2.0 Brewer and both have had issues with over-pressured pods, which causes an extremely large mess before I leave for work pretty consistently. I dread making my coffee every morning, wondering if it will explode today. I had the same issue with the first, which Keurig graciously replaced, but the same issues continue with the new one. I think that there is a product flaw with this particular model. ",1.0,1
I bought this about two weeks ago.  I have little counter space so needed a smaller food chopper.  It's compact but has a lot of power. I like how the cord wraps around the appliance. I have made fruit purées and salad dressing. It's also really easy to clean. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],5.0,-1
The machine will make a cup of coffee occasionally - the rest of the time the machine tells you brew interrupted and you spend the next hour trying to clean the thing out. I have wasted way too many k-cups trying to get a cup of coffee. This Brewer is junk. I have owned other Keurig Brewers and was always a happy customer. I am no longer happy.,1.0,1
"I only used this about 5 times.  First of all, it's extremely difficult to use!!! I had to try to lock it and unlock it numerous time before I can get it working.

"We bought this Keurig for a Special Education class to use in their coffee cart business at the middle school. We bought the Keurig in September and now it no longer works.

I have bought the 3.5 Cup food processor keeping in mind that it won’t take much space in mu kitchen moreover it is so versatile that it does all my daily cooking preparation job. From making corse paste to purée it does wonder every time I use. Hot tip - Its even best to make smoothies and small batch batter for pan cakes as well. But my favorite is to make frozen Mango Sorbet and Mango Lassi. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.),5.0,-1
"Do yourself a favor and please do not purchase this product. I purchased my initial brewer in June and am now going to be on my 3rd...yes third brewer. It seems as if the brewer works for about 3-4 weeks and then it completely stops functioning. I called customer service this morning, and although both workers I spoke to over the last two months were polite; I was told that the best they could do was send me a new brewer. The warranty for a cash refund is thirty days from the point of original purchase. I am tired of this machine and having to waste my valuable time talking to customer service, wasting k cups, and spending time at FedEx (you have to send pack a part within 30 days in order to be offered the free replacement.) I was understanding when this happened the first time, but now I am beyond frustrated. How can you not offer me a cash refund when you have already had to ship me two replacements? What does that tell you about the quality of the product? I saw some questionable reviews before I purchased this product, and if I could go back, I would have listened. I had always been a fan of Keurig and had the Vue in the past. Never again.",1.0,1
"My little mini mincer finally died after many years of service and I decided I'd replace it with a small food processor that I could store in my TINY kitchen and that I could also make pie dough and hopefully pasta dough with. Well, there ARE no small food processors so I ended up looking at choppers and settled on this one partly because of the KA name but also because I think somewhere I saw a mention of making dough in it. Anyway, I bought it sometime this year and have used it for various chopping jobs and been VERY happy with it - so much more consistent as far as size than a blender or my little mini mincer. But I never had worked up the ambition to try pie crust. And now, of all times I chose Thanksgiving day to try it. Thank heavens, it worked and worked beautifully. I only made one crust at a time since that's a cup of flour and 1/3c. shortening. And about 10 quick pulses and it was pretty much perfect. I DID dump it into a bowl and do the 2-knives method for a minute or so just cause I couldn't quite believe it was done. But it was and I'm a happy camper. I think this will inspire me to try a small batch of pasta dough.

P.S. - I've noticed a couple of negative comments about taking the lid off and taking the bowl off the base and I, too, thought there was something wrong with mine when I tried, following the instructions, to dismantle it the first time. But since then, either because of experience or use, it has become very easy to do, so if you have trouble stick with it. The end result (a great little chopper) is worth it.

"I purchased the K200 to replace a true single cup Keurig. It worked great for a bout 5 months. Now I have to babysit it just to get one cup of coffee. It only gives you about 2 oz, of less each time. It takes about 4 to five times to get one cup, I tried just the hot water function and it seems to work fine. I tried cleaning it and it made only full cup and then went back to its old ways. I use it at work. We have an older Keurig at home that has worked great. My frustration level is on the rise and I almost feel like tossing the thing in the trash.",1.0,1

I purchased the K200 for my office. It's small size fits well on my desk. I prefer this to the Mini Keurig I had previously. This machine has a water tank and with the old machine I had to premeasure the ounces of water. I like the fun colors this machine is available in. I think it makes a great cup of coffee but I find it a tad less hot than my Mini brewer. I do think that the knock off K-cups will have a plastic taste but if you stick to real branded K cups there is no problem.,4.0,1

My coffee mugs are all large and again I have to brew 2 times to get a full mug of coffee or 3 times to get a full mug for tea as the hot water only brews 4 or 6 oz sizes. Who drinks only 4 or 6 oz of tea??? I also do not like the fact that I cannot use a reusable pod. I miss my custom blends of the seasons and my freshly ground beans. I wish I never spent the money on this. I am going to resurrect my old one - I haven't tossed it yet - and it still brewed better than this model. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED KEURIG!

I have two 10oz cups every morning at home. Sometimes more throughout the day. The great is it was cheap with the use of my points and it did brew a good cup of coffee for me. Whats not is my brewer acted up a few times and then died yesterday. 3 months is all i got. I did call customer service which was very helpful and are sending me a new brewer free of charge. I liked the Vue 550 brewer i had before this way better. For whatever reason there is nowhere near the variety of coffee which is why i switched to the Kcup. I hate the waste though. I liked being able to recycle my Vue pods after each use. Drop the Kcup and make all the flavors in the Vue pod. Vue Brewer and coffee was so much better.,3.0,1

"We bought the Keurig 2.0 and were so excited to use it. We got two in one day, both having the same problems. Here's our issue: 1. Leaves a lot of coffee grounds in the coffee. I had read that the needle is puncturing the K-cup filter. Poor design. This was the biggest issue because it's undrinkable. 2. Sometimes it makes the right amount, but most of the time it's way off. We brew 10 ounces and only get 4-6 back. 3. It ONLY uses Keurig brand coffee. Which isn't a major problem but a little annoying if we want to try other brands. 4. It brews hot, but not hot enough. Coffee makers are supposed to brew hotter than the consumer can stand to allow for adequate cooling, and allows for adding of refrigerated creamers. So what happens is my coffee now gets cold very fast. Previous Keurig's we've owned did not have this problem. 5. We have had it one day and it no longer dispenses coffee. The screen continues to read ""error"" even though we have done everything by the book. Will be returning for a previous model. To add a positive note, I loved the option to make the coffee stronger, and it did exactly that! Disappointed in this model, but looking forward to Keurig hopefully making a better version.",1.0,1

I had owned a Classic and it gave me dependable service for about 3 1/2 years. I should have stuck with that model. With this new model, it seems about every 3rd or 4th cup we brewed, we not only got a cup of coffee, but we got a cup full of grounds spilling over from the K-Cup into our coffee. This was a brand new machine, and we read and followed the instruction booklet to the letter. We did not overfill the water tank. We tried securely placing the K-Cup into the holder, and we also tried just loosely placing the cup in the holder. Made no diference. We also used fresh filtered water. With each mishap, I disassembled and rinsed the cup holder, then ran a cleansing brew of plain water to make sure all grains were cleared. It never failed to happen again at some point, and after 3 frustrating mornings of dealing with it, I gave up and exchanged it out for the classic.

I bought this keurig thinking it was new and wanted to replace an old one. Coffee comes out luke warm and never is hot. In order for me to get a hot cup of coffee I need to put it in the microwave after the Keurig finishes pouring. There is no setting as in older models to change the temperature so I am left microwaving constantly. Absolutely the worst temperature I have ever had a cup of coffee. If I was the only one I would think it's me but the 3 people in my family all agree. For a new machine not to have a setting to increase temperature is ridiculous. Called Keurig and they didn't do anything. At first I was disgusted about all the kcups I had that I couldn't use if that wasn't enough my coffee needs to be nuked in order to drink it.,2.0,1

"I've been using a multi-cup coffeemaker for years, and could never bring myself to splurge on a Keurig since I'm the only one who drinks coffee in our house. After trying the Keurig K250*, I'd be lying if I said that I could ever see myself going back to my old coffeemaker! PROS: This has been so easy to use. The machine heats up quickly and makes a nice HOT cup of coffee. My old maker didn't even spit out coffee this hot, so it's nice to get coffee at the temperature it should be. Since I started using the Keurig, I've also learned that I've never made a proper cup of coffee. I would sleepily stumble to my coffeemaker, dump a little coffee in the filter and turn it on. Then, I'd dump half a cup of creamer into it just to cover up the flavor, which was different every time. I love that the Keurig takes the guess out of measuring. I get a great tasting cup of coffee every time. I've even discovered that I LOVE my coffee without creamer. French Roasts and Hazelnuts not only smell great, but they taste divine now too! I can get a few days of use out of the machine before it reminds me that I need to add more water. It's a little annoying, but with my old maker, I had to fill it every day, so that's just me being lazy. haha CONS: No, major cons. I didn't really find too much that I didn't like about the machine. It is a little noisy. Nothing super loud, but louder than my old maker and I do worry that it will wake up the kiddo if I'm trying to brew a cup during naptime since their bedroom is right off the kitchen. It was a lot bigger than my old machine and does take up a good amount of space in our tiny apartment kitchen. It's not the largest machine in the world, but I'm not sure if I would recommend it for apartment/dorm living or for anyone who had little counter space. I wish it had a clock/timer function like my old maker, but that's nothing that would keep me from purchasing this machine. It is true that this machine can ONLY use the 2.0 K-cups with the special white ring on them. There are plenty of ways around this, but the simplest solution is just to buy a 2.0 reusable k-cup. They're easily accessible for purchase in most stores. I picked one up and have been using it for weeks, without issue, in my K250 2.0 brewer. Overall, I'm very glad that I got the chance to try this machine out for myself. The pros definitely outweigh the cons, and I would recommend this machine.

"Bought this chopper a couple of weeks ago, love it.I have previously a Black and Decker and a Rival unit. On both units the problem was chopping onions. The would chop uneven leaving you with bigger and smaller pieces. By the time the bigger pieces were down to size the smaller ones were mush.

Bought it as a replacement for similar kitchenaid chopper that was no longer functional to clean because apparently the blade welded itself to the base unit after being running in short bursts to chop some cooked meat chops.

"I LIVE for coffee, strong cup first thing, multiple cups throughout, adore the smell, the taste, the everything about it. I also live in an apartment with limited counter space, so when I purchased my Keurig Mini I was very excited. I LOVED my mini, have had it for YEARS, brewed a fantastic cup of coffee whenever I wanted it. My boyfriend moved in and we used the mini more often, and his travel mug is bigger so we used to brew two cups to fill it, he also likes a stronger brew, and well the mini - after years of use just didn't keep up and broke down (I think I actually shed a tear). So, we purchased a K250 - set it up, swapped the toaster oven for a toaster because of the space, and well ... it looks pretty. Despite the 9 brew sizes it claims to brew (HUGE draw to this machine), the bigger machine doesn't really brew anything more that the mini did. Evidently it's a standard 4 size (and the 10oz is actually less that the 10oz my mini brewed), it's not stronger, not even when you press the strong button, there's no auto shut off, additional 3 sizes are available but only if you buy the KMug (and only 9 varieties available), and the rest are for the carafe (but only for cup portions), so the 9 brew sizes aren't truly available... The strong brew tastes more like water poured over ground up beans than it does a good cup of coffee. We're waiting upwards of ten minutes for the machine to warm up each morning, and overall just disappointed. Worst money on a Keurig spent and zero benefits ...",1.0,1

"This is just a great product!. I have to laugh at some of the silly, negative reviews on this machine. Every problem that I read in the reviews has a simple solution. For instance, you can use a My K-Cup Filter and use whatever kind of coffee you want. Read several reviews saying how ""selfish"" Keurig is and how limited you are on how you can brew coffee. Just not true! Read that you can't brew 10 ounce cups with K-Cups. Again, not true. You can brew 4,6,8, and 10 ounce cups with K-Cups. As for old K-Cups people are complaining about, the only ones that don't work are K-Cups from 2014!! If you have K-Cups that old, it's time to throw them away anyway. This K200 can do anything that an old machine can do and do it so much better with much more freedom, ease, and variety. This is my second Keurig coffee maker. My first one was the Office Pro from 2011. Loved, loved, loved that machine. It still works great and gave it to a friend when I got my K200 2.0. The K200 makes so many improvements and is so much easier to clean as well. I love how quiet the new machine is and love the water filter too. Pick up any of the new 2.0 machines and you won't be disappointed. You'll get a good, cup, mug or carafe every time. Have some friends that have the K500 and they absolutely prefer there new machine from their old Keurig machine. Really wanted the K500 model as well but this K200 just fits my limited counter space so much better. I really love Keurig and can't even imagine going back to a regular coffee maker. So happy with my purchase and I hope that this K200 brings me the many, many, many days of great coffee and beverages like my Office Pro did for 5 years. Thank you Keurig!!!!",5.0,1

It's not as compact at I had hoped, it takes up the same amount of space as my parent's older Keurig does, so that makes the amount of usable counter space I have in my small kitchen a bit of an issue. I was surprised by how noisy this unit is as the large commercial unit we have at my office is really quiet, as is the one my parent's have.

"I upgraded to the K250 after having one of the recalled mini's. I was waiting for the K250 rather than just get another mini because I was reading the features and really wanted bigger cup sizes. First of all if you are using a regular k-cup you only get 4 cup sizes, 4/6/8/10. I was hoping to go to at least 12oz for my bigger mugs. I cannot see a way to do that unless using a carafe. There are very limited options on the screen. I do not have a carafe but presumably when you remove the tray and insert a carafe you get more options? It's not a bad looking unit but also if I leave it plugged in like my two older keurigs it does actually stay on with the water heated. I don't like that. I don't want to have to unplug every time (because I know I will forget) and I feel it dangerous to leave heated all day long. The only advantage I see right now is that I can fit bigger mugs in without having to remove the drip tray - but I can't fill them. I am sure the carafe would solve a few of my issues but it doesn't come with the K250, you have to purchase it. Looking at the reviews (about not keeping warm) and the pictures I have seen I am not sure a plastic carafe would be worth the extra money.

"I got a Keurig K200 for Christmas. It is way easier to use than my old espresso maker, and I love that I can choose a color other than black or white (yay turquoise!) as well as pick coffee, tea, cocoa, or hot water. The water takes about a minute to preheat from a cold start (only two seconds if it's been preheated earlier) and about another minute to completely finish brewing a 10oz K-cup set for strong. The brew size does depend on if you're using a cup, mug, or carafe pod (K-cup only goes up to 10oz) however you could do 6oz and 6oz to get a 12oz size, 10oz then 4oz for 14oz, or 10oz and 6oz for a 16oz for the K-cups to get a larger size. Personally I prefer the 10oz K-cup as I like to have room to add cream and sugar or whipped cream without worrying about anything spilling over. Although older K-cups won't work in the newer brewers, you could solve the problem by using an accessory like 2.0 My K-Cup to put the older K-cup's coffee in or find an equivalent coffee in one of the newer K-cups. So far, I haven't had any trouble with coffee grounds in my cup or water spilling into the tray, but I did check my cup sizes first and I wait patiently for it to finish completely. It's quite new so I haven't had to change the filter or descale yet. I like how the instruction manual covers everything and has a problem solving guide in easy steps. Really the only trouble can be the total cost, as accessories such as the carafe ($20-$30) and 2.0 My K-cup ($15) are not included, as well as storage for the pods ($25-$30), although the cost of the coffee for the maker is much cheaper than the amount I was spending (generally less than $1 per K-cup versus about $5 for one 14-16oz cup). All in all, I'm very happy with my new (turquoise) Keurig coffee maker!",5.0,1

"I waited to write a review until I had my Keurig for several weeks to compare performance against the many reviews that already existed (especially the negative ones). Pros: First, the system is everything I needed in general for brewing a single serve cup of coffee - nice and hot, plenty strong. I enjoy the flexibility of different flavors with every cup. It is easy to use, actually stores on my counter under the wall cupboards with enough space to lift the lid to place in the cups. Having a variety pack of the regular coffee and teas has been wonderful for guests who all have differences in opinion for which coffee/tea to have, and although more expensive than knock off brands, not out of line for single serve coffee preps (especially when ordering in more of bulk size number of cups). Since I am one who orders gourmet beans for flavored coffees using an online service, I am anticipating the release of the My KCup for this model. Cons: Most of the things I didn't like are not deal breakers, but more wish list vs. general functionality. A better staying and easier to replace water reservoir lid (easy to misalign and fall into reservoir), drip tray not attached to unit is too easy to move. One too many screens for access for dispensing water. Too long a time until auto shutoff of the unit (for my type of usage, which is typically morning and evening only - not all day use). Comments vs. other negative reviews: 1) I did not need a ""to go"" carafe cup size and did not order this product expecting it to do so as the specs for brewing were provided. 2) After washing my carafe before use, I did not experience the ""smell"" that others have. 3) I have never experienced grounds coming through the system. 4) I have not experienced any program or power issues with this unit as were described in other reviews - and the water dispensed is hot enough to burn! Suggestions to Keurig: A larger reservoir would be nice, but as a single cup user this could lead to microbial issues. 2) Programmable for specific user preferences would be nice since there is more than one user in our household. Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review!",4.0,1

Handles nuts, seeds, onions, garlic, purees all with ease; minimal features but they all work seamlessly: the touch-top-pulse mode is fun and fast, the 2 modes on front are simple to use, just flip the lever to chop or puree; it's relatively quiet for having such a high-speed blade, its easy to disassemble for dishwasher or hand cleaning, and the price is great!",1.0,-1
"I received this about 3 weeks ago and here is my critique: Straight out of the box it is a little difficult to assemble the food bowl onto the base. There are no handgrips or indents to grasp. So my hands aren't always dry when preparing food. The base keeps slipping in my fingers. Another thing I noticed is that there are no recipes for a novice cook. For example perhaps a simple salsa, or mayonnaise or even Hummus. Just 2 or 3 simple ideas to get someone started. On the positive side: This little baby is perfect for those occasions when you are not prepping for a large group. It chops and purees perfectly and quickly with minimal noise. Clean-up is super easy and it takes up so little space on my work counter. All in all I love this mini processor. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5.0,-1
"Nice sized mini processor. Handy for chopping vegetables quickly.  It's not a full sized food processor and is  limited to chop/puree, which is exactly what I was looking for!

"Was looking for a compact food processor that could handle simple stuff without taking up much room. This food processor has handled everything we've thrown at it so far: hummus, pesto, date paste, nut butters, and biscuit dough.

It's perfect. Finally a food processor for a single person. It doesn't make so much that I can't use it. It doesn't take a whole bunch of space. It forces you to make sure you don't go overboard because it fits everything to a good portion size for a single person. It blends perfectly and cleans up easily.

I enjoy how quick it is to brew a cup of coffee, especially since a full pot would be too much for one person. The display is very easy to use and intuitive. My one complaint is that there isn't an option to adjust the beverage temperature. For some reason, the Keurig at my office brews hotter than this model. I personally prefer my beverages on the hotter side. I enjoy the variety of K-cups that are available, but I wish that previous versions were compatible with the 2.0 systems.",3.0,1
I needed a somewhat smaller chopper for small batches.  This one is the perfect size.  First use was to make a batch of guacamole & it turned out to be the best!  I love the size and ease of use.

"This is the 2nd Keurig Machine that I have owned and will be the last. Not only am I beyond frustrated, I purchased the machine only to get it home and found that it had been previously purchased and used (and broke and returned the store with a used K cup still in it GROSS) I then came back home and unpacked a new machine and had problems with that one, and called Kurig customer service only to be treated rudely. This machine does not read the top of the K cups nor does the outside of the packaging indicate that you CAN'T use your old K cups with it. So folks if you don't have the right K cups - beware, you will have to go out and purchase the right ones to use with this machine. Then, hold your breath that the machine will hold the water and it won't leak all over the place. Horrible experience with this thing!!!",1.0,1

I have used several small choppers and this product by far is the best. The two speeds makes it super easy to puree foods.

"This is my first Keurig and I couldn't be more excited to write about how amazing it is! It is SUPER easy to set up, quick to brew and quiet. The little touch screen gives clear step by step instructions on what to do next which is great. K-cups came with the Keurig which was amazing since I didn't have any just laying around but wanted to try it right away! My first cup was English Breakfast Tea. I'm not a huge coffee drinker so tea is my preferable option and this tea was amazing. Fresh. It took me back to my first encounter with Breakfast Tea on my trip to Ireland a few years back. It is now my special treat on the mornings that the kids actually sleep in a little and I have some (rare) time for myself. I have even tried several of the coffee blends and they are very good! They are fresh and of higher quality. I prefer my coffee brewed over ice so I froze some of my favorite creamer and brewed it right over those cubes and it was amazing! It has me so excited for the warmer weather that is coming as it will replace my morning cup of hot tea. My husband has jumped right on the coffee train with me and drinks a LOT more of it than I do and is absolutely loving the Keurig .It's easy to make and maintain and no clean up after it's brewed right in to your cup! His one word after his first sip was, delicious. So all in all - 5 stars for the Keurig 2.0 machine itself as it is sleek, modern, and perfect for a home kitchen counter. I've yet to read on other special things it can do but for the morning cup of coffee - it's perfect! I'm excited to play with new settings and recipes and see just exactly all of the things that it will have to offer. I've seen recipes for oatmeal, soups and more and I can't wait to try them out! The k-cups they sent with it are fantastic. There is quite the variety to choose from and each one I've had so far is supper yummy! I'm excited about expanding what I already know is going to be my k-cup collection and even learning about how to re-purpose the cups and grounds and make every little bit count! So if you're in the market for a new coffee maker - go for the higher end and snatch a Keurig - it's well worth every penny!",5.0,1

"As a Keurig mini owner, I upgraded to the k250 and it is way better. The water reservoir is removable and easy to clean which was a previous issue with the Keurig Mini because the water reservoir for the Mini is non-removable. This makes it hard to clean especially with mineralization. Since I am an everyday coffee drinker and am now addicted to caffeine, I was pleasantly surprised when there was a ""strong"" setting. It also has setting for ""Hot Cocoa"" and other which I was also surprised by. Definitely going to purchase some other types of Kcups because of that. In comparison to the Mini, the clearance for cup sizes is more versatile. The Mini can really only accommodate short mugs while I can fit my tall thermos under K250. Overall, it's a little bigger than the Keurig Mini but it's size is fair in terms of brewing systems. I currently have the black one and it looks great on the countertop. Nothing too flashy. Easy to use because the touch screen prompts you questions. I would definitely recommend!",5.0,1

"I have used the Keurig in the past when it first came out and I was pretty impressed. I had a small one but that one unfortunately broke. I stop by Dunkin Donuts every morning to pick myself up a Medium HOT Latte. Well let me JUST SAY…NOT ANYMORE. Go pick yourself up Keurig 2.0 immediately! Some may think I am crazy but I brought my Keurig 2.0 to work to share with my co-workers. I also purchased the reusable pod so I can pack whatever coffee I like versus buying the pods. Compare my $3+ daily run from Dunkin or getting a box of 12 pods for $8.00 which equals out to .67 cents a day…which route would you choose? Honestly speaking, I was so used to Dunkin Donuts that I thought I liked it! Well after taking a week break from Dunkin and then picking one up on the way home one afternoon (It was a long day at work) I was so unhappy. I needed my coffee from my Keurig. I have seen and read reviews about the old K-Cups not working on the 2.0 versions. I have not had an issue. I bought my reusable pod but I have also used K-Cups from the 1.0 and it worked just as fine on the 2.0. I love this Coffee Machine and I am looking forward to purchasing another one.

As some other reviewers have said the water tank is a little hard to get on and off but I'm sure it will get easier with time.

"Setting up my brewer wasn't as easy as I expected as I ran into an issue during it's initial setup - it took about 15 minutes and me turning the system off before it was ready. The instructions didn't exactly match the setup process that I noticed. I like how quiet the system seems to be, but there are two negatives I can think of: 1) I don't like how you have to use specific k-cup packs that teamed up with Keurig. As I try to transition to more organic coffees, I don't like being limited to what I can use. 2) For the price, I can't stand that it doesn't come with a carafe. And, of course, it supposedly only works with the Keurig Thermal Carafe for another $30 plus shipping.

"I received this machine as a gift and while it worked just fine I actually upgraded to the 450. It worked well, but was too small for my needs. In a two adult household it seemed like I was refilling the reservoir every day. The reservoir being on the back was a bit cumbersome with the machine being on my kitchen counter underneath cabinets. I had to pull it out and refill the reservoir each time. The motor was also very loud. I called keurig support and they said that over time it would get quieter, but this was just not good for me. It still brewed just fine and the coffee was good. I'd still recommend to a friend because I do believe that it would work great for someone in a college dorm or military barracks who wants a good cup of coffee without sacrificing on what little counter space you have.",4.0,1

"This is, without any doubt the most expensive way to waste your money. I drink no more than 3 cups a day and this thing has been failing to work as advertised since month 2. My personal favorite is the completely white screen that doesn't allow you to do ANYTHING., and Keurig's helpful response? Please unplug and ""hopefully that will solve the problem"" and the good news is that it does for about 3 cups of coffee. Oh, and sometimes even unplugging it does not work. On top of that, the reliability of the machine is about 20%, each day is a new adventure on what won't work on this machine. Some days it takes (no exaggeration) 20minutes to ""preheat"" , and at least once a week it won't produce a full cup of coffee (no matter how often or well you use their little unclogger thing). Add to this you can't use any pods except those made by/for Keurig and that you can't dispense more than 6 oz of hot water at a time (go hang, tea drinkers!) and that the water filter required is an extra 20 bucks, and what you have is an overpriced trashcan ornament. Keruig, complete fail. I'll be taking my business elsewhere. Between the lousy equipment and your lackluster""customer service"" I'll never purchase a Keurig product again.

Makes my life easier and I purchase these for my children when they move out on their own.  NO HOME SHOULD BE WITHOUT ONE.

"Have previously owned older models of Keurig brewers. In order to make a larger cup, we use the same K-cup twice. However, when you try to use the K-cup twice with the 2.0 system, it tears the top and bottom of the K-cup and most of the coffee grounds end up in the cup. Took 2.0 back and purchased a K40 which is better suited for our requirements. 2.0 works very well for smaller cup sizes but not suitable for our needs.

This chopper works great for small jobs. It chops evenly without completely pulverizing onions and peppers. I use it all the time for chopping for meals and soups.

"I had been looking for a blender to mix small recipes (my huge Vitamix doesn't handle small volumes well). After trying several small blenders (like Nutribullet), I discovered they all required a significant amount of liquid in the recipe. The KitchenAid food chopper was able to handle dry jobs very well. I have only used it 3 times so far, but it did an excellent job chopping sticky items (dates) and mixing up recipes. And it's easy to clean - top rack of D/W. It's also cute and takes up minimal space. If you want a smoothie, use a blender; but if you have drier ingredients (truffles, cole slaw, etc.) this is a handy appliance to have.

It fit perfectly with the bowl & lid on.  I have a KitchenAid free standing mixer and love it so I felt confident that this mini-chopper would be high quality.  And I love the red!

I debated on buying the trendy baby bullet but when I looked at the price and did my research I decided in the kitchen aid product because I could use it for my making my babies puree and later on for my everyday use of chopping etc. The only down fall I have to say is its a little mess because it leaks out the side. But the machine is easy to clean so it makes up for it. Highly recommended over any baby puree system. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.),4.0,-1

"I got this as a Christmas present, and I waited till I had a chance to put it through its' paces.
I made a double recipe of Irish Potato & Herb Soup. 2Lbs of Potatos, 2 large carrots, and 2 large onions, 6 oz. ham. Normally I would have used a mandolin to cut up the veg, as the old mini chopper had gone through its' 3rd bowl and lid combination (the locking points keep breaking). 
It gave a nice fine set of chopped veggies and ham.
The locking points on the KitchenAid are internal and not sticking out like the old unit, so they shouldn't break. Do want to get a second bowl and lid combo, so I can wash one, and still have one ready for other courses of the meal.
My wife likes it because it's quieter than the old one, that was noisy from the get go.

"I used my Keurig today for the first time and I love it. I have one of the older versions of a Keurig and that one works well, but this one is awesome. The best feature would have to be the touch screen. I mean does it get any better than that? It's pretty cool. I love how it also can make up to 4 cups of coffee. I've always used just my regular coffee maker to make more than one cup of coffee. Now, it's convenient that Keurig has come out with this product. It also makes the coffee a lot quicker. The machine is silent when brewing which is nice. Another plus is that you can fill it with a lot more water than previous Keurigs and you can stick a water filter in there. Overall, I definitely recommend the Keurig 2.0 K250 for those interested in a great, fast and easy coffee maker.",5.0,-1

"This is my 3rd Keurig. I use my Keurig only for one cup a day, 3 days of the week. This model's needle clogs very easily and is frustrating when you are waiting for your cup of coffee. The brew isn't as strong and hot as I would prefer even with the stronger blends. I have started to use the reusable coffee holder and use 2 K cups pods worth of coffee to get a strong enough cup. Kind of defeats the purpose. I most likely won't replace this one when it dies which based on my other 2 keurigs will be in 2 years.",2.0,-1

"Before buying a keurig, I would use a french press to make my coffee in the morning. That became very tedious and time consuming every day. I thought that a keurig machine would be lacking in flavor, but I was wrong after testing it out. The coffee is just as rich and smooth as before, except now I have many more varieties to try out. The most outstanding difference is the time it takes to make the coffee and lack of cleanup required. My only concern is the size selection for just water. It only offers 4oz and 6oz for water, which really is not enough for a hot cup of water (at least 8-10oz). Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review.",5.0,-1

My dad has a Mini Keurig that was purchased 6+ years ago that I've always loved and has held up quite well. I'm very glad I opted for the 2.0, as the Minis these days look and feel really cheap. The 2.0 is only $20 more, but exceeded my expectations in almost every way. The touch screen is much nicer than I expected, and I love the options it gives.

I have to sometimes fall back on my old school drip coffee maker on super cold mornings for a really hot cup. Also, I've wasted quite a few new pods because the machine does not recognize it. Try taking the same pod out and putting it back or unplugging the machine to trick it and it still does the same thing. Not really happy for wasting a perfectly new pod.",2.0,-1

"I upgraded from a 1.0 Mini and the K250 has been truly impressive so far. I use it everyday and so far it stays pretty clean (it even comes with cleaner for later on) and I don't have to worry about cleaning out gunk from the spout to get CLEAR, hot water if I choose to have tea instead of coffee. It does take a few moments to heat up, but it's relatively quiet and produces a steady stream of beverage. The only things I don't care for is there are only two cup size options (4 oz and 6 oz) for the hot water, yet there are three sizes for K-cup pods (6 oz, 8 oz, and 10 oz). If I want 10 oz of water, I have to run both the 4 oz and the 6 oz. Also, sometimes it doesn't fill the mug as much as I think it should. I appreciate the color choices as well as the extras included. All things considered, I'd recommend this to anyone! Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review!",4.0,-1

"Received this product as a gift. After years of using my old Keurig Mini , I was excited to get the new 2.0. Bottom line, I went back to using my old keurig mini after about 2 weeks. Nothing I do removes the burnt plastic taste from my coffee. I have soaked all removable parts (water reservoir, k-cup holder, etc) in white vineagar over night, spent an hour running white vinegar and water cleanses through the machine, and I even washed all the removable parts in the dishwasher (something you're not supposed to do but it was my last resort). Nothing I do removes the plastic taste and smell. Everything I try to brew is undrinkable. Reading the reviews from other 2.0 owners, I see I am not the only one drinking coffee that tastes like a burnt barbie doll. I have been a loyal customer for years, and even recruited my parents to the brand (my mom owns a coffee shop so this was quiet a feat), but I am now fearful of the plastic being used in the new 2.0 brewers. This will probably be the last Keurig product I use.",1.0,-1
"I use my new Keurig between 5-6 times per week. Generally in the morning to kickstart my day from a long drive to work. The brewer has only one coord and ""installation"" is very simple. When you turn the brewer on, it begins a preheating stage which may bother a few as it takes anywhere from 30-60 seconds. Then you select the strength of your coffee and size and the brewing begins almost immediately. In comparison to previous versions, I believe this version is much easier to use, it feels faster, and is easy to clean and maintain. Noise levels are tolerable and the touch display is convenient. The new water tank is convenient for such a small sized Keurig in that I don't have to add 8 ounces of water to my Keurig each time I want a cup of coffee. With that being said, I feel that the primary flaw, as with all Keurigs is that whenever the water falls down to a certain level in the tank, you can no longer have a cup of coffee, tea, etc. You must have it filled to a certain unmarked point in the water tank to have coffee. Not a big deal but I wish the water could all be used before having to add more water. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who drinks a cup of coffee once a day or more, especially at the office. Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review.",4.0,-1

My first taste test was great, I was worried about the pods not being fresh. I am used to grinding my own beans and keeping them in the freezer. But I was pleasantly surprised. Fresh tasting coffee. I do like coffee a bit strong, so on my next brew, I pressed the 'strong' button! I loved it and will have to always remember to press that. By the time I used the Keurig the 5th time, it was not working. I put in three different pods, and it was only dripping. I was devastated!

"Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review. I am happy with the single cup brewing. However, the size of the carafe compared to how much water it takes to brew seems like a waste of time. Also, the carafe can easily be moved out of the slot which means the entire brew must be started over and the k cup is wasted. For now, I will continue to brew single cups of coffee. I find that one K cup is very strong, so I use the K cup twice to get a larger cup of coffee that is not so strong which creates a more enjoyable hot cup of coffee.",4.0,-1

"I bought the K250 at a discount with Club Keurig points. I've had it for a few weeks now and love it. I don't drink coffee, but I drink tea nearly every day. I love the reservoir and that I don't have to fill it with every cup like the Mini, although the Mini is great, too. I've made hot tea, iced tea, and cocoa. I also like that I can put taller cups under this than the Mini. FYI for any wondering, the min fill line for regular cups is about 2 in from the bottom of the reservoir and is not printed. The one printed on it is the min for a carafe. It will tell you when it needs more water. Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review.",5.0,-1

I put celery in the chopper and have not long strings or big pieces left when I pull the celery out. I have not needed to puree anything yet, but cannot imagine that it would not be perfect.  The only thing I had trouble with in the beginning was getting the lid on correctly. You have to make sure it aligns and then you can press the chop/puree buttons.

"I love this for making a quick cup of coffee. I really like how there's so many different k-cup brands and flavors so you can have a different cup of coffee every day. I have even made iced coffee with it and it worked great. It was really easy to set up with the instructions. One downside is that it is a bit loud, I have seen other Keurig machines that are much more quiet. It's not the worst thing ever but just a note. It seems like the water goes pretty quickly, maybe the tank isn't as large as some others that I've used before but since I'm usually only making one or two cups I don't actually have to fill it that often. I haven't tried to brew a carafe but it's great that is an option incase you wanted to make a pot of coffee. Overall a really great product that I would recommend to anyone.",5.0,-1
"I used to have a mini food processor and when it died I didn't really miss it.  Then I was given this to test in exchange for my honest review and I am so happy I have it!  I have a 13-cup Kitchenaid Food Processor, a Vitamix blender, Cutco knives and Pampered Chef gadgets galore, so why in the world would I need a mini food processor? As it turns out, I use this almost daily!  To cut veggies for tuna salad or meatloaf, to whip up my blue cheese salad dressing, to scramble eggs for my family, to make applesauce, grate parmesan cheese, make bread crumbs, hummus, and salsa, all done very quickly. It's a great size, and I love that the cord stores easily in the bottom, just wish there was a place to secure the plug.  After I figured out how to lock the bowl in place, it's very easy to use.  I like that there are two settings, and how easy it is to start the motor by pressing with my thumb on the bowl cover.  The bowl has a handle for easy pouring, and the Twilight Blue color is gorgeous. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5.0,-1

"Sadly my original Keurig died and I needed a replacement.  I though this smaller, sleeker model would fit the bill.  Sadly, it doesn't.  The water reservoir doesn't hold much and it has to be filled from the back of the machine.  So if you have your machine under a cabinet, it's quite inconvenient.  Also, I have NO idea how to change the filter.  I'm prompted to do so but I can't find it and the manual doesn't tell me either.  If this were my only Keurig experience, I'd never buy another one.  This thing stinks.  Spring for a pricier model.",1.0,-1
"Hi, although the results are good--and I appreciate being able to select a chop versus a puree function--I am rarely able to assemble the chopping blade and basket so that the machine turns on with the first attempt.

"This is a huge improvement over their smaller Keurigs. You can choose more cup sizes and it has the optional Carafe you can buy to make a pot of coffee. It also has a hot water feature and a reservior so you don't have to fill it up everytime you want to make coffee. I like how you can have different coffees all the time and not have to worry about using up one bag of coffee before opening another. It is especially handy to have with different coffee drinkers in the house who like different things. The single-serve K Cups also ensure your coffee is always fresh. Though definitely not a deal-breaker, one con is that that I wish you could brew more than 10 oz without having to use the Carafe pods. For instance, 10 oz doesn't fill up a large coffee mug or travel mug, and I don't want to make a whole pot just for those. Also the product is a little more wasteful than traditional coffee since you are using a disposable K Cup each time, and I'm not sure if my recycling company wants me throwing in the bin the pods with used coffee grounds in them. However, the Keurig's benefits outweigh these concerns, and it has already replaced my old way of making coffee. I find myself drinking coffee/tea more often and at different times of the day than I had before. It brews much faster than my old traditional coffee pot, and the hot water feature makes non-K Cup hot chocolate or tea 10x faster than boiling water on the stove. I cannot review the K Pods or Carafe since I do not own a carafe (yet), but I'm sure it would still be faster to brew than a traditional pot. Overall, this is a great product, and although I was initially skeptical on its practicality, I can't imagine not using it.",4.0,-1

"I've had this chopper for about 2 months, and overall, I like it. I wish it was just slightly bigger (without making it to full size food processor size) because I always seem to find that I need just a little more space. The other thing that I struggle with is that the blade snaps into place pretty tightly (a good thing I suppose), but when I remove it, I have to pull with some level of strength which causes food to fly all over the place. And, even though it snaps so tightly, food still finds a way to get into the space under the blade. Also, when I wash it, water gets under the buttons and it takes forever to dry out. It does its job. I'm just not sure I would purchase it again. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)",3.0,-1

For years I always used and old 1 cup mini chopper made by another manufacturer and often times found it to be too small for my needs. I always wanted to buy a big one but the old one still worked so I would just deal with it. Then my sister bought me the Kitchen Aid 3.5 cup chopper and I just LOVE it. It's just the right size for medium and larger needs but not as gigantic as a food processor (which I have no room for in my small kitchen). I have been using it for 5 months now and love it. It's easy to clean and use. My only negative is that I wish the body had ridges or something on it because if my hands are wet it becomes harder to take off the cup from the unit to empty it.

"I had the Mini Plus brewing system which was working fine for two of us until there was a recall and I was sent an ugly covering for my beautiful machine. So I sucked it up until I saw the K250 2.0 system was released. I got the turquoise as this matches the rest of my small appliances. I like this one more than the Mini because it holds water for at least 3 brewings for us. The color and look of it is amazing. I am really pleased that they came out with this color as I was waiting on it! We brew about 1-2 servings a day and it's been nothing but good to us. I prefer this machine over the Mini because it fits many more cup/mug sizes. The only thing I find somewhat annoying is the amount of time it takes to warm the water. For a smaller-sized machine, I expect it to be ready when I turn it on, but I guess my Mini brewer also took time for the water to warm. I also do not like that I can't use non K-cup pods since I had a few boxes of pods left over but it's no biggie since I still have my old machine. I have purchased but not yet tried the carafe pods.

"I upgraded from a mini-keurig that I had for 2 years. I like that this has the water reservior so I don't have to add water every time, but it takes a long time to pre-heat the water.

"I use the product everyday for my morning on to work cup of coffee. The biggest size it makes is 10 ounces, I would love if it made up to 12 ounces. You can make a carafe with 4 cups, but you have to purchase the carafe separately and you have to be special k-cups that are made for the carafe. I also feel super wasteful using the k-cups and just tossing them after each use. It is easy to use and has an option to do just hot water which is nice for many purposes. It has a built in water filter and comes with cleaning supplies. I have not tried to clean it yet so I cannot speak to that. It doesn't take up much counter space and has a sleek design. Comparing it to a hamilton beach that is similar but is a bit bigger as the 4-cup maker is actually 8 cups and sits on the side. It would be useful and more worth the price if the Keurig came with the carafe for brewing more.",4.0,-1
"I received this food processor as a present for my birthday. I have yet to use it extensively, but have used it for a variety of different food prep needs.

Does a good job preparing dressings &dips. Chopping for home made bread crumbs also good. However chopping vegetables and nuts is no better than a blender. Some not chopped some very small.

"This food chopper is an improvement over the last generation in operation.  But, the lid is not as robust. Dropping the lid in the sink or to the floor (wood, not slate) can break a piece off.  With a small piece (about 1"") gone from the mating side of the lid to the bowl causes the chopper not to operate sometimes.  The lid replacement cost with shipping is about 2/3 of the total chopper purchase price.  The breakage is my fault as I dropped it (not covered by warranty).  But, a product that's used in a kitchen should have a more robust plastic.",3.0,-1

It's easy to read the time across the room, and if your electricity goes off in your home for any reason the clock goes back to its prior time and settings.  Though it can run on batteries, if you want it illuminated all the time as I do, you have to plug it in an electric outlet.  This is a real bargain.",5.0,-1

"Cons:  Impossible to read unless you're facing it, the background numbers all bleed through and you just see a lot of lines and squares.  
Pros:  Big enough to read easily if you are facing it, even in the dark since the face is back-lighted when it's plugged in to an electrical outlet.  
            Easy to set, a big plus compared to so many we've had and returned.  
             Good that it is ""atomic"" and will re-set itself for the stupid DST stuff those who consider themselves our superiors impose on us.  ;)

"I love this chopper!! I can make homemade salsa in 5 minutes! I make a lot of pasta salads, barley salads, Chinese Chicken salads, veggies for spaghetti sauce in no time at all. It's a small chopper but does big jobs quickly. The clean up is a breeze too, way faster than a larger processer, even if you have chopped raw meats in it. I put warm water and disp soap in the chopper, do short pluses, buzz, buzz, buzz. Rinse with warm water, bingo ready to go again. It's so handy because of its smaller size, takes less room to store and just easier to work with than those big bulky processers. I use my chopper nearly everyday and would feel lost without it. I love my chopper and would recommend it to any one who loves good fresh food but wants to save time and energy in the kitchen. Would be great for any level of cooking from the novice to the professional. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)",5.0,-1
The display is nice and big. It stays lit and gives you several options of how you want it to display. I like that it runs on ac but has battery backup in case the power goes out and you won't have to bother resetting it.

This Keurig is better than one I had in the past since it's much more quiet, I can make tea without having to worry about waking my roommates up. In addition to this, the water heats up and disperses quickly so when I'm on the run to work I can quickly grab some tea without worrying about being late. It also accepts a wide variety of k-cups which is very nice to know I won't have to go out and buy a new set. Lastly, the design of the Keurig is great because it's sleek and fits almost anywhere, it's not as bulky as some have been in the past.

"Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review. I have never had a Keurig or similar brewing system before this item. I needed a quick and easy way to make coffee before classes (I'm in college) and this seemed to fit the bill pretty well. I knew several people who have Keurigs and they all seemed to like them so I went ahead and purchased one. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase. The Keurig does exactly what it was advertised to do, but unfortunately this model does have a few drawbacks. I find that when going above 8 ounces or so, the coffee tends to taste weaker, which is just a drawback of the system I guess. Also, because of this, there is no option to make 12 or 14 ounces for travel mugs, which I found disappointing. Finally, the new 2.0 models of Keurig requires you to use the Keurig brand cups, which is kind of annoying. This is not too much of a drawback for me, however, because I planned on using the disposable cups anyway. If you are looking for a quick and easy way to make a cup of coffee, this if for you. If you want to use your own coffee or make more than a cup, you may need to look elsewhere.",4.0,-1
"I've always loved Keurigs since the first time I used one, but I was hesitant to purchase because I don't have a lot of counter space. The K250 is perfect! The smaller water tank makes the unit much slimmer and I can squeeze it back in a corner of the counter. I actually like the small tank better because it forces me to use fresh water. And the color is fantastic! Every morning when I look at the turquoise machine, it makes me even happier than I already am to get my delicious, fresh cup of coffee. Though it can brew the carafe-sized pods, it does not come with an actual carafe, so this keeps the cost down. And I love the settings on the 2.0 system that allow for a 4 oz, 6 oz, 8 oz, or 10 oz brew, and you can even select to brew it ""strong."" The quality of the brewed coffee is great. I use a reusable pod with a local coffee that I grind myself, so no wasteful plastic pods filling up a landfill.

"The Keurig K250 is one of the best brewers that I have ever used.

Who needs fancy drinks from overpriced coffee shops when you have a wide variety of K cups and new 2.0 K cups which allow you to brew up to a full Keurig pot or in my instance, a 14 oz cup every morning.

Bought it 2 weeks ago and it doesn't have a hole to feed food into it. Have to stop and open to put food in it after you process it. Won't work right with everything you put in there at one time.

I got this recently and it is my first food processor.  I started using it right away.  First use was for egg salad and what would have taken me and hour was done in less the a minute.

"Having survived cancer treatment, I needed to find things to help in the kitchen.

I bought this a couple months ago and have used it a lot. It's efficient and chops or purées evenly. It's even a little quieter than my last chopper. The top does require a little more drying time because water gets under the buttons. It doesn't affect any part of the processor. You just shouldn't  close the lid tight for storage until it has dried. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.),4.0,-1
"I bought this item and did have a small problem with it the first time I used it...I could NOT get it apart to clean it. I called Kitchen Aid who immediately sent a replacement.

"I bought this small food processor a couple of weeks ago.  I have a larger one (not a Kitchen Aid), but it always seemed to be so much trouble to use, that I simply did not bother.  This one is handy, works wonderfully, and (as food processors go) is quiet.  It's perfect for me, and because it's not humongous, I actually use it...a lot more than I thought I would.  Can't go wrong with Kitchen Aid. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5.0,-1

"This is a handy and easy to use mini food processor.  I can mix up a batch of salsa, marinara or pesto as quickly as I can wash the tomatoes.

"I have used my food chopper several times since purchasing. So far I have used it mostly to prepare items for desserts. Nuts, making crumbs, etc. I am very pleased with how my items turn out, exactly like I need them, some fine some chunky. I do not have much storage space, so the size works well for me, even though I can't process the quantity that I need at one time, it fits well into the spot in the cupboard.

"I received this for a shower gift a month ago. I have been very happy with it. 

It works excellent for chopping vegetables. I used it just this week to chop up tomatoes, jicama, onions, zucchini and bell peppers for a Mexican chopped salad and it saved me SO MUCH TIME. I was also able to use it to puree baked carrots for a soup. It does better at chopping than pureeing (it's a food chopper, not a food processer), but it still worked. I just had to spoon through the soup and re-do some larger chunks of carrot that escaped. 

It is little which is great for my small apartment kitchen. 

Pros: 
Compact
Powerful
Sharp blade
Affordable
Easy to clean (careful, the blade is sharp!)

Cons:
Small, forcing you to do many tasks in batches
Buttons on lid seem unnecessary and could just as well be on base (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)",4.0,-1
"This little machine is great for people that have a small family.  It is just the right size, but works as well as the bigger food processors.  It is also great because it doesn't take up too much room to store as we live in an apartment.  The only reason I didn't give it full stars is sometimes it is difficult to get it locked into place, maybe as I use it more I will get used to lining it up correctly to lock on to the base.

Not very happy just got the unit for my birthday and not even a week later having issues. Call the number and the lady was very nice and tried to help. First I told her that this unit has already cost me 7 pods at almost $2 per pod that was around $14 down the drain. And I was not happy. Then she told me I should clean the unit once a week. I told her I would when it came to a week. LOL. I told her I only use the ones with their logo on it to insure it would work and she told me to try too clean it. In short 3 cleans later and over 40oz of H2O and two more pods ($4) they are sending me a new POD holder and a coupon for 1 Free Hot Bev Box/Bag. On the unit I would give about 1 stars. (I did get some coffee out of it. LOL) On the service I would give 4 starts (because I give no one 5 because there is always room to improve.) We will have to see how it goes after the new POD holder.,1.0,1
I got this as a gift for my birthday and I took it off to my college apartment.

This is not my favorite Keurig product for 2 primary reasons:  1. The crescent shaped water container is awkward to remove and set. Constantly spilling water.  2. It occasionally clogs and you need to use the included tool to remove embedded coffee grains that prevent water flow.,3.0,-1
"4 years ago I received my 1st Keurig (I believe it was K55 Model) and had a wonderful experience and never any problems.  For an early Christmas gift, my parents purchased me a new replacement Keurig-Model K250. I was excited to use my new Keurig but found the coffee is not HOT, at best it is just greater than lukewarm and you cannot leave it set, not even for a few minutes!!!  The Keurig specs states the temperature is set at 192 Fahrenheit yet this model only heats to 160.  This is contrast to my former model K55 and am very disappointed.

"Used my new processor for the first time today and was pleased with the consistency each small batch of antipasta it produced.  Aside from the initial difficulty I had removing the bowl, all went smoothly.

"For many years, I had a smaller version of a food chopper, by another manufacturer.  I thought that it was really great, and even bought some for gifts for people throughout the years.  I saw this in the store and saw that it was slightly bigger than what I had at home, and realized that I often would have to grind foods in smaller quantities several times in preparation for a meal.  

I bought this one, and it is just perfect in size.  I can do most of my chopping in one burst now, instead of repeating the process several times.  A can of tomatoes, and in seconds, you have tomatoes for stewing.  I didn't realize how much this could be better than my old one, but it sure is !!  I now feel bad for buying people the older, other brand, smaller model.

The picture looks so much better then the actual set. The quilt looks faded and dingy. The shams don't have the same design on both of them. The package the set was placed in was ripped and the throw pillows were falling out. The actual card board they packed it in was barely taped and the box was torn in several places.

"This is the first Keurig machine that I've owned and I have to say the whole experience has been really good. I use this machine at work in my office five days a week. The coffee has been great tasting and brews very quickly. My only complaint would be that even on the 10oz. size, it doesn't fill my cup completely. I know I can buy the larger K-mug sizes, but I was just a bit disappointed that I would need to to fill my cup to the top. That being said, I really like how easy the whole operation is. The main reason I bought this machine was to get away from all the cleaning I had to go through with a normal drip machine. Measuring the coffee, dealing with the grounds, it was just a big pain. The 250 works just like I expected it to. Thinking of getting another one for my wife and I to have at home. Also, I've noticed a quite a few people complain about having to buy the sanctioned K-Cups for the 2.0 machines. My local stores all seem to carry a really good assortment of the correct pods.

"I use my beautiful new Keurig 2.0 k250 everyday, sometimes multiple times a day. My drink of choice is the sweet and creamy donut house brew over ice (so good). This is my first Keurig, as I was always skeptical about brewing just 1 cup in a limited size. I previously used a traditional coffee maker to make a pot at a time. I was very impressed that I am able to fit my tall 24oz tumbler without issue and my even larger 32oz mason jar style tumbler with a little modification. I have not yet purchased the carafe, but I plan to do so in future for when we have company. Although, we had several guests over and I made 5 individual cups in a row and the machine never skipped a beat! And so fast too!! The 40oz water resevior is great! I would say the only con for me, is that I was expecting it to be a little more compact. The design is very sleek, and the machine is narrow, but I still feel it takes up as much room as a traditional brewer. We have a very small kitchen, so my K250 currently resides on a shelving unit rather than the counter. It is a great product I have and would continue to recommend to a friend.",5.0,-1

"We are not big fans of bitter/strong coffee, but sometimes my wife feels like having coffee with milk, in which case, she wants the coffee to be relatively strong.

I also sometimes want strong black coffee, so it works well for me, too. Another thing we really like about this product is the design of the water reservoir. In particular, the fact that it is transparent makes the whole brewer look much smaller than it actually is. We really think it is stylish and well-designed.

"This is my first Keurig - I love that everyone can have a different flavor coffee without making several pots. My hubby can have strong coffee and I can have regular, so we are both happy. It's also great that you can make 4, 6, 8 or 10 ounce cups of coffee for people who want more or less coffee. It is smaller than my old Mr. Coffee coffeemaker and has so many more options. I'll never go back to the old coffeemaker!",5.0,-1
"I got the orange colored machine and so far I am content with it. I use it in my office and like the miniature size for conserving space. The larger restoring is also a great perk versus the original mini Brewers. I like the digital display but wish it had a time function so I could set to auto brew like my larger version at home. Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review.",4.0,-1
"I love this brewer. The touch screen is very intuitive and easy to understand, also, it includes a lot of extra settings like a checkbox for the desired strength of coffee and a hot cocoa setting. The lower tray is removable to accommodate for larger cups. My favorite thing to do is grab a large cup, fill it with ice, and brew an iced coffee k-cup to have a cool, refreshing drink. The only complaint I have is that it is a little bit noisier than the previous Keurig brewer, but it is worth it for the extra features.",4.0,-1
"I am the only coffee drinker in my household, that's why I wanted a single cup coffee maker. After doing my research, I decided I wanted this model. It's small enough to not take up a ton of space on my counter, yet not too small that I can't use any size cup I choose. The system is really easy to us and easy to clean. I have had no problems with it at all. My only beef with this system is that I have to fill the reservoir, it seems, like every other day. Not a big deal in the realm of things, but nevertheless , a little annoying. I love that I can now have different flavors if I want more than one cup of coffee/tea, and I don't have so much coffee left over from traditional brewers. I really do love this model and have been enjoying it every morning.",5.0,-1
"I absolutely love my Keurig, I will never use anything else! It is so easy to use - and very versatile with what it can make. Coffee, Iced Coffee, Tea, Iced Tea, Hot Chocolate, and Hot Water. Works perfectly, it is a little bit noisy but much quieter than a previous version of Keurig I had. I wouldn't trade it for anything else. The only downfall I have is it does take a while to heat the water but I can deal with that. Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review. Holly",4.0,-1
"I love my Keurig! As a busy college student, it is absolutely perfect for those long nights studying or when you just need a little pick me up. I cannot wait to try more k-cups. I love the various size options for those days you just want a taste or when you want more. The options are endless. I bought mine in black to match my other kitchen items but I also loved all the fun colors you could choose from! I also love that it holds more water than some of the other Keurigs so I do not need to worry about filling it up as often. Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review!",5.0,-1
I absolutely love Keurig Coffeemakers. I have three and each of my three children have them as well. NOTE: you can use your old k-cups. just tape one of the new k-cup tops to the old ones and they work. I do it all the time. I love fresh coffee each and every cup. LOVE KEURIG!!,5.0,-1

"I have always done my own chopping with a knife, but sometimes I tire of the long times spent in the kitchen - and this has been a welcome addition.

"I purchased this item to replace a cheap Black Friday (not Kitchenaid) version. This one works better, plus the rubber feet on the bottom help stabilize the unit.

"Recent spur of the moment purchase that turned out to be a great buy! I've been searching for a small food chopper that was easy to use, clean and store.

"I use it almost everyday. All the parts are easy to use and clean. The capacity is great for any small to mid-size meals. It's also space efficient, even if I leave on top my counter, it does not clutter it up.

I am very happy I got this processor, my older food processor was 8 cups,I do not miss it at all. This has been able to make everything the big one did and more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5.0,-1
"I like the design, light weight and simplicity of the KitchenAid 3.5 cup food chopper. One flaw, however, is the cord design. It is thick and clumsy, too short and difficult to manipulate so that when one uses the machine it can wobble on the cord unless you position it just so that the machine is sitting solidly on the counter. It performs well and is simple to use with just two buttons, and looks pretty displayed on the counter. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)",4.0,-1
"I bought this processor to replace an old Cuisinart model that I had for years and years. I choose it because of its ""look"" of stainless steel which matches my current kitchen appliances which includes a new Kitchen Aid stove. The mini processor has several design features which make food preparation easier for the home cook. The top a a well place spout through which you can add liquids such as oil and water slowly while the processor is running. It can chop, blend, and puree. The nifty channel that houses the cord for storage is easy to use. The mechanism on the handle for depressing the start button holds your finger or thumb very comfortably. It is easy to disassemble and clean and stores away nicely in the cabinet with no cord hanging down. I love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5.0,-1
"This product doesn't perform quite in the way I was hoping it would.  I purchased it for the purpose of whipping up sauces like chimichurri, pesto and salsas.  Nuts get lodged between the blade and the wall of the container, preventing the blade from spinning. It's not quite powerful enough to handle a sauce that uses whole nuts. Good for chopping small veggies though. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)",3.0,-1
"I asked for this product for Christmas, and I love it!  I could not be more pleased.  It's a stylish streamlined design, and its blades make those chopping tasks so much easier!

"Better for Mayonnaise and dressings than a blender. But still can ""grind"" a pound of chicken with fair control from a course chop to a paste within seconds.

"This is my second Keurig. I tried to go back to a regular coffee brewer after my first Keurig needed to be replaced after 5 years of constant use..... and I lasted a few months. I really missed having a Keurig! I purchased the Keurig K200 in Sandy Pearl yesterday and absolutely love it. It is smaller and less bulky than my 2010 machine. Set up was a snap! Love the touch screen and water reservoir. If you use filtered water from your refrigerator, the reservoir fits easily in the water niche and doesn't take long to fill. Overall I am thrilled with this machine. Welcome back, Keurig!!!",5.0,-1
"I liked the compact size of this processor, but had a difficult time figuring out how to make the blades turn.  After several frustrating tries, I was finally able to get the blades to turn.

Overall this is a really great machine! I've never had a Keurig before so I was pleasantly surprised when I started using this specific machine. It's great for a quick cup of coffee but a bit difficult if you don't like the flavors or specific brands since only cups can be used. But I really enjoy the machine overall! Super easy to use.,4.0,-1

"I am very happy with this chopper.  My only wish is that they would make one with a piece that would slice as well as chop in this size.  I had one years ago, but cannot find one that slices.  All in all this chopper works very well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",4.0,-1
"I recently switched from the basic Keurig to a Keurig 2.0 and I was surprised by how different the two are! The 2.0 was a bit complicated to figure out at first but I would definitely recommend this one! I use my Keurig daily, before work and in the morning on the weekend. It's quick and easy and each cup is brewed to perfection. I never have to worry about making a cup too strong or weak. I also love that there is an option to brew loose leaf tea. The possibilities are truly endless.",5.0,-1
"I've used this for chopping carrots and pumpkin, and it worked very well on both. The capacity is perfect for me - it chops about 2-3 large carrots at a time.

I received my chopper one week before Christmas just in time for my baking. It replaced me old 3 cup chopper by KitchenAid. It was very easy to use if you read the directions first. It chopped every thing I needed for my baking quickly with ease and accuracy. I made about 37 dozen cookies and candies with no problem. I loved and used my previous chopper so much and hoped that this one would be the same. I was not disappointed; just wished the bowl had a handle for stability when removing from base and emptying.

"I have been using a Keurig brewer for a few years now and have always been satisfied with my original, older brewer. I was ecstatic once I received the 2.0- I have always been ""behind the times"" on technology, so this was a great chance to upgrade to a better Keurig system. I absolutely LOVE coffee, I can't get enough! Iced, hot, lattes, you name it, I'll drink it. My first impression of this system was how beautiful the design is! My other brewer had the water reservoir on the side, I love that this once has one on the back, and it's much larger, so I don't have to refill it after only a couple cups. I also love that the design fits in nicely with my other black kitchen appliances. Once out of the box, it was easy to assemble and get her all set up. This newer brewer doesn't have that plastic taste or smell from the factory like some of the older brewers do, so that is a plus! I popped in my first K-Cup and I was ready to enjoy a hot cup of delicious coffee! Since I had been using a Keurig for years, of course I had tons of K-Cups in stock. I ran into the problem with the new system not recognizing the older K-Cups. I think I heard there is a fitted piece you can install to get the Keurig to recognize the older cups, I haven't tried that yet. Honestly, this isn't a problem for me because there are so many cups available on the market. I did wish the box came with the carafe it boasts, Im not sure where to purchase the carafe or the K-Cups to use it, but I am definitely interested in trying that! I highly recommend this brewer to anyone who enjoys a fast on-the-run great cup of coffee, or to anyone who likes to sip while reading a good book. This brewer makes consistent, delicious coffee every single time, without fail.",5.0,-1

"I love this Brewer! It's sleek and sophisticated design goes well with other kitchen appliances.It also doesn't take up much space so those with a limited amount of counter space don't be worried. 40 ounces of water can be held in the reservoir at once and heats up in 3 minutes or less. For those on the go this is great for fast-paced mornings, it is also easy to use and it's touch screen gives you step by step directions. You can also control the strength of your coffee and I personally like my coffee weak so I'm glad I am able to dictate that. Overall wonderful product, Keurig pulled through with this one, allowing me to skip the coffee shop before work!",5.0,-1

But the size of the unit at the point where the removable ""work bowl"" meets the base is too large for most women's hands.

"There is so much to love about this little machine! I can't wait to see all the colors the brewer will come in! First, it's a nice, compact machine. We also have a K550 brewer, and it's about half the size. It's quiet and fast, and I LOVE the option for hot water (those with a previous 2.0 brewer will know what a big deal this is, you used to have to hold down the brew button and it might spit out a couple of ounces at a time!) Pros: -compact, quiet, easy to use, comes with a cleaning piece and descaling solution Cons: -no auto-off feature (and you have to hold down the power button for a bit for it to turn off, you can't just push and release) -reservoir is on the back of the machine, not the side, and a bit tricky to get it to seat properly until you get used to how it fits on there. If you're putting the machine under an upper cabinet in the kitchen, it'll be harder to fill the reservoir than other models Overall, I'm really happy I received this machine in exchange for my review, and think it'll be perfect for small kitchens (or those that want to take up less space on their counters) and we're definitely taking it on vacation with us!",4.0,-1
"I bought this in order to make good food toppings for the world's fussiest dog!  It works great!  I cut up chunks of meat, and put them in.  The processor makes short work of a boring task and makes a lovely meaty topping for his kibble.  The processor is small and easy to use and store.  And, best of all, it's a Kitchenaid, at a terrific price!  A mini workhorse! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5.0,-1
"I use this brewer to enjoy a hot cup of coffee before I rush off to work and on weekends. It's super quick and offers tons of flavors, cup size, and strength options.

I bought the 200 model when it first came out but didn't use until 1 year ago. As of last week the heating element no longer heats.

I got this because I wanted a smaller machine to chop food rather than using my much larger food processor. This is just what I needed and works like a charm. It does have a smaller capacity and sometimes I need to run it twice if I decide to chop more than it can hadnle at once. But it's so easy to clean and use that I really love it.

I usually use the brewer when I come home from work but I am looking forward to purchasing some K-mugs to brew a larger size to take to work. I have used a Keurig brewer since 2009. These new machines are much quieter and are very easy to use. The ability to brew 3-4 cups at once is awesome. I wish I had bought the next brewer up such as the k300 for the larger reservior and thr auto - off feature. I have received compensation/free product for my unbiased review.,5.0,-1

I love love love this product! I don't actually own it but I am constantly going by my mothers house just to use hers before I go to work. She has the white one and I want the turquoise.

This was my first Keurig I was tracking the package I was so excited. I wanted this for work and I was going to buy one for my home. It felt like Christmas when the package arrived at my home. I put everything together my sister was so jealous when she was saw what came in. I went by all the directions setting everything up. I hit continue and the message Please add water appeared on the display. I thought it was my mistake. I emptied the water put more back in I made sure everything was put in right. Still 'add water please' would not go away. I looked it up it had something to do with the sensory couldn't read that the water was in there. Something about that you need impurities in the water I don't know. Apparently the county water is cleaner than I thought. So it was returned the next day sadly. I don't feel like going through this again so my plan B is Mr. Coffee I heard those were okay too.,1.0,-1

"This Keurig was purchased for office use. We needed a compact one but this model holds enough water for several cups of coffee before refill.

So far, we are all happy with the purchase.",4.0,-1
"As the title says, tiny, but powerful. I was worried that getting such a small food processor would mean I would have an issue getting things properly blended, but that's just not the case.

"I've been a Keurig user for several years now and this new brewer doesn't disappoint! It was very easy to set up and start brewing my first cup. A few of the reviews I read before ordering the 2.0 K250 indicated it was noisy during the brewing process. I didn't find it to be noisy at all. Refilling the water container is easy and I like that it is positioned on the back of the brewer instead of the side, which leaves a bit more room on the counter. I also like the fact that there are several choices for the size of cup you want to brew. I've only been using this new brewer for a few weeks, but so far I'm very pleased with its performance. Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review.",5.0,-1
The chopper works faster and cuts more evenly than I had guessed it would. I use it for mainly veggies but tried cheese on pulse and got a good result. It accommodates a good amount to cut at one time so I save time. Washes easily and I am very limited on space so it's size is great. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.),4.0,-1
"The K250 was purchased to replace our 2014 K500 whose pump died.  We had about 7 months of spotty performance with the K500 blowing up pods (which were sent back to Keurig) and partial fills of cup.  We liked the Carafe feature which drove us to the K250.  I like the narrower footprint of the K250 - it fits better on our coffee bar.  This is our 4th brewer in over 10 years.  We have a Mini also in use.  The Keurig doesn't have 12oz cup size option as shown on the website, the max size on the one we got was 10oz. for cups.  I have not tried the MUG size feature, but have brewed 2 5-8 cup carafe's.  So far so good.  The only feature I miss the the auto-off feature.",4.0,-1
"I love this Keurig! I've never gotten one before, and this was the perfect one for me. It's quick, easy and tasty. It does exactly what a Keurig is supposed to do. No more, no less.

"I love the brewer - it's the right size for my countertop and it consistently brews a great cup of coffee. My only problem is that there isn't any way to turn it off without unplugging the power cord. I brew a cup every morning; I don't want or need the brewer to keep water preheated 24 hours a day.

"I bought this K200 brewer about 3 weeks ago and am in love with it. It brews fast, great cups of coffee at the literal press of a button. I use it every morning, multiple times a day, as I frequently drink coffee. Brewing a cup is easy as fill with water, insert pod, and brew. The downside is the max cup size for the pods is 10oz which is a bit less than the size of my cups. Also, it is very difficult to ensure you are buying the proper 2.0 pods in the store.

The more and more I use this coffee maker the more disappointed I am with it.  I don't like the fact that I cannot set the time to turn on and off the machine.  My old model which lasted me for years did this.  I wish I had thought of this when I researched a replacement.  The coffee is never hot enough.  It takes way too long in between cups to heat up.  The reservoir is much smaller and there is always condensation.  The overall quality of the machine itself seems to be inferior to some of the older models... everything is made of plastic and it just feels and appears cheap and this by no means was inexpensive.,2.0,-1
"This is my third Keurig machine and it is my least favorite by far.  I love the Keurig single serve beverages, which is why I keep purchasing these, but this one has more hiccups than I prefer.  It was given to me as a gift, otherwise I would have returned it.  We drink a lot of coffee throughout the day around here, and it seems like we are constantly refilling the water reservoir!  And even this I could handle if it were easier to access like my old model with the side reservoir.  The lid doesn't even hinge to make it easier.",3.0,-1
"Since getting our Keurig we have started drinking more cold coffee's, and teas, and quit going to the coffee shop. We love the variety of K cups Keurig offers. However we have found some in other brands we would love to try as well, but this Keurig only take Keurig bran K Cups. While we understand the reasoning behind it, we wish we were able to purchase and use whichever brand we would like.The other con would be that we wish it came with the carafe rather than us having to purchase one at an extra $30. Pro's .. we love how fast it is, that we can brew hot and cold, and that if we just want hot water for a regular tea bag, that is possible as well. We love the fact that we can enjoy coffee shop type drink at a fraction of the price and do not have to drive the fifteen miles to get them. My husband is THRILLED with our Keurig and I am as well. Easy to use, great selection, and quick. If we were able to use any brand K cups and it came with the carafe I would have given it the full five stars.",4.0,-1

"As I mentioned above, the stability of the machine is not great. It rocks back and forth everytime I push the button or lift up the handle. The water reservoir is not very convenient.

"We absolutely LOVE our Keurig ,and the assortment of wonderful products that go along with it. Making coffee, tea, iced tea, etc, is a breeze. Since we started using our Keurig we have noticed we are drinking more iced beverages, which is what we would normally purchase a the coffee shop. Some people say the pods are expensive, but when you factor in the round trip drive to the coffee shop , plus the product we buy, we are definitely saving money using the Keurig. That being said, we do wish that you could use other brand Kcups as well. We have found a variety we would love to try, but aren't able to. I understand the reasoning behind Keurig making the machine this way, however, the ability to use a variety of k cup brands would make this even more valuable in our household. We do like that there is the ability to brew a carafe rather than a single cup, but don't like the fact that we have to purchase the carafe separately at the price of approx. $30. I would definitely recommend this to friends, and family as it's a great alternative to the coffee shop, there is a great selection and it's quicker than a traditional coffee maker.",5.0,-1

"I've had my eye on this food chopper for over a year. I kept debating because I had a full size food processor so why did I need a mini one. But I kept coming back to all the times I need one onion chopped or one cup of an ingredient blended. It was hard to bring out the food processor for one little thing.

I use a few times a week and is perfect for my needs. Just a few minor personal preferences that are missing, like auto-off function, having to manually press the touch screen to power off makes me feel the touchscreen may eventually go bad, but only time will tell.

"I have never been much of a coffee drinker mainly because I didn't care to make a full pot of coffee in a traditional coffee maker. I have never had a Keurig before so I can't compare it to other models but I love this machine. I drink 90% more coffee now because of how easy and quick it is to make a cup whenever I want. I wasn't sure what to expect when I started to brew my first cup but I was so impressed. It was easy to set up for the first time and I love the way it looks. It is a good size and looks nice sitting on my kitchen counter. One complaint I have heard is that it would be better if you could use the reusable cup like in other Keurig models. I can imagine that would be helpful for people who drink a lot of coffee as the K-cups can get expensive. I, on the other hand do not drink enough coffee for it to be that big of a problem.

And if I decide I need a second cup to cure my afternoon crash, it's not a problem. I only wish my travel mug fit under so I could brew and run out to enjoy my coffee in the car loop. I also love that it despenses hot water for an evening cup of tea or to make the kids hot cocoa. One thing missing is an auto shut off. It would be nice if it turned it self off after a certain amount of time.",4.0,-1
"Arrived as a 6 pack and is as soft before and after the first wash as claimed. One day of the week the bath has no hand towel but what can I say, they do not arrive as a 7 pack. Also, there were no loose threads or excess lint after drying as directed the first time. There is a loop with the name brand that is large enough to use on a hook if that is your choice. The color is said to be beige, but they blend well with my ""Bone"" colored fixtures.",5.0,-1
"These towels are a beautigul red color. The first 10 times I washed and dried them, there was so much lint in the dryer trap that I had to keep emtying the  lint trap so that I could avoid a fire. After they were washed several times though, they looked like little threads were coming out all over. Beautiful color, though",3.0,-1
"This Keurig machine is pretty amazing! I thank the coffee gods for the 10 ounce option and the option to make my coffee ""strong""--because, I mean, there's only one reason for coffee! The machine has a really sleek look and I'm really excited about also being able to make both single cups and carafes now because sometimes you just need cup number 2 at the same time as cup 1! Also, the machine has a really sleek design that would fit well in any setting. Unfortunately my kitchen is a bit older, but changing out my outdated machine for this one honestly upgraded the feel. The following are my two qualms with my wonderful new machine, which TRULY in no way would outweigh the benefits it offers: 1) It takes a bit longer for this Keurig to turn on and preheat, etc. as compared to my previous one. This is only upon first plugging it in, though, so if you leave it plugged in, you're all good. Once the machine is up and running, it works really quickly and despite the various features it offers, it's super simple! Secondly (and this may just be caused by my reservations to veer away from exact guidelines), the minimum fill line and maximum fill line seem to be only one 10-oz cup of coffee away from each other. Devil's advocate, though, that ensures that you're using fresh water for each brew! :) Editor's Note: Ryan Braun was not Nicole's favorite Brewer, rather the only one she was aware of post-Prince Fielder.",5.0,-1

"This product is convenient and easy to use, making the process to get ready for work faster. Its touch-screen features are a huge plus for today's day and age, allowing for easier access and easy ability to brew a cup of coffee. The timeliness of the product is great too; it only takes a few minutes to brew coffee. The only concern I have with the product is that you have to fill the water all the way to a certain line. Sometimes, I would like to just put a cup of water in the machine. However, the product is still great because you could just leave the water in the machine for the next use.",5.0,-1

"This is a great step up from the original Keurig I had. I can now brew my coffee either by the cup, travel mug, or carafe. True this model doesn't come with a carafe, but for the price it's well worth it. With this being an entry level Keurig 2.0 if you add a carafe to it the price is still lower than the other Keurig 2.0 models. It also has a touchscreen with several options to choose from with each cup or carafe of coffee brewed. This is a more compact model compared to my other Keurig so I can save more counter space in the kitchen for other things. This particular model of Keurig I had received as a gift. Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review.",5.0,-1
Watch out washing this with your white towels. Will turn your other laundry blue. Otherwise they are decently soft and absorbent.

"I bought these towels in red, which is a beautiful color! However, when I washed them, the lint trap was so full, that I had to empty it 4 times during the drying cycle.

I am disappointed!",1.0,-1
"After only 2 washings the bath towels already have pulled threads. And they sent a completely different bath mat than was sent with the blue set I ordered earlier, which I thought was odd.

"I have to start by saying that the Keurig is fairly large and takes up quite a bit of counter space which can be a bit of a problem if you have limited counter space. The K-cups also take up a lot of room regardless of whether you store them on the counter or in a cabinet; and again, if you have limited counter/cabinet space that can be a bit of a problem. When brewing your coffee/tea, the Keurig is a little noisy, but it's not terribly loud. The K-cups are convenient, but they are really bad for the environment so you have to take the time to recycle! With that being said, I do have to say that the instructions for the Keurig are super simple to follow, it is really easy to clean, it is really easy to brew your coffee/tea. The thing I like the most about the Keurig is that it is extremely fast at brewing your coffee/tea. This is great, especially when you are in a hurry and rushing out the door!

The hot water dispense is another great feature. It looks great on my countertop alongside my other stainless steel appliances.

I notice a lot of people complaining that not all K-Cups work in the 2.0, and that's true- I got some Crazy Cups in my variety pack that don't work, so I just open them, dump the grounds into the reusable cup and brew.

We finally have a way to entertain guest without having to pass out coffee one cup at a time. It's so much easier to make a pot of coffee and keep the flow going. The water tank is also a plus.

"I bought this Keurig because my old one was, after several years of use, not brewing a full cup or sometimes wouldn't brew at all. This one was a decent price and had lots of fun color choices! I love how it brews and has an easy-to-use touch screen. The one problem I have with it (and I didn't understand or realize this when I bought it), is that you can't use certain K-cups in it. I have a BUNCH of coffee and tea products that I can't use in this because they don't have the check mark on them, but they are still a Keurig product! I wrote to them about it and their solution was ""give them to someone that can still use them in their brewer"". Well, for one thing, I paid good money for those and I don't feel like just giving away all my coffee and tea and I don't know anyone nearby that I can give them too. They did try and compensate by giving me two free boxes of coffee/tea with the purchase of two boxes. The trouble with that is they give you the same promotion code as when you bought the machine and you can't use it twice. Instead, of giving such bad advice and a code that you can't use, maybe they should give you a free reusable K-cup coffee filter that can work in the 2.0, because my old ones don't work in here either. While its a really nice brewer, I feel like I have to re-buy everything I already have! Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review.",4.0,-1

I really like the Keurig 2.0 250. It's small enough to replace where I kept my toaster on the counter. I keep an extra jug of water nearby to it to make it easy to fill up in the morning. I like how quick I can get a fresh cup of coffee. This is great since my husband doesn't usually drink coffee and I don't want to make a pot for myself in a traditional coffee pot. The iced coffee flavors has gotten him to drink a few cups though.,5.0,-1

"I've been using a Mr. Coffee Single Serve for years, so it was time for an upgrade. This machine looks sleek and stylish on my countertop, and the display makes it easy to use. Also, the option of brewing a stronger cup is definitely a plus for me. All in all a great upgrade. I have to admit though, that the amount of time it took to preheat was a bit longer than I expected, but it brews cup after cup pretty quickly right after. Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review.",4.0,-1
"For the amount of coffee my household consumes, I can't believe we didn't upgrade sooner. We are a Keurig house, and had a K45 for the past few years. It was awesome…then we got this guy, and boy are we in love. It looks so sleek on our counter, and technology challenged husband even can use the touchscreen with ease! The carafe is amazing and It makes life so much more convienent when we want to drink more than one cup at a time. I think if it wasn't apparent before, this coffee maker seals the deal for us being loyal to Keurig!",5.0,-1
"I spent 2 hours on the phone with customer service. They were so patient and di everything to help. We did multiple vinegar rinses plus up to 12 water rinses and still the taste and smell of plastic was evident. We exchanged the brewer and went through he same process. I was determined to fix it. Unfortunately after a couple of cups of coffee, the taste came back. Had my previous Keurig for 4 years....",1.0,-1
Given as present last Christmas. Trouble brewing more than one or two cups in a row without having to do complete cleaning. Even this doesn't prevent the explosion on the next cup. Talked to a service rep that sent out new interior parts. Helped briefly but now it's a guess as to whether you get a cup of coffee or cup of grinds and big mess on counter. Have been ordering and using pods from you. Disappointed at best,1.0,-1
I love this product! It is great quality like the Keurig 2.0 but it's much more compact. I think its a huge step up from the Keurig Mini but just under the 2.0 because of the smaller water reservoir. If you live in a small area by yourself or with one other person this is the most ideal Keurig you could get! Everything you would want/need from a coffee maker!,5.0,-1
"I tend to drink coffee a few days a week, haven't gotten to the everyday cup. This is perfect for me, when I want coffee or tea, I can brew a cup and go on without leftovers. I think it is quick to brew a cup and it comes out perfectly hot. I like that I can make the coffee stronger. It does take up a bit of counter space but I can get over that. And I hope they come up with a pod that you can put your own coffee in it instead of having to buy pods. But overall I am very satisfied with my brewer!",4.0,-1
"I'm writing this for my mother who received the Keurig K200 for a Christmas gift. A friend had given her the KCup pods to use in the new Keurig, but to our dismay they were not usable. The OOPS message came up with 4 of the pods we tried..all different varities but usable in Keurigs. I decided to call the customer service # on the screen & they were quick to fix the problem. It seems that this Keurig pot is equipped with a laser to read the top of the pods & the pods we had were not newer pods. The new pods will have a lavender, grey or white ring on the edge of the pod top. Thank you very much to the customer service agent that assisted us last night.",4.0,-1
"After having friends and relatives who owned a Keurig, I decided to buy my own. I like how easy it is to use it, but I should have bought a higher model (i.e. K350 maybe) because I have to constantly refill the water. The coffee is not as hot as I remember it to be when drinking from one made with the older model, but nevertheless tasty. I'm glad I purchased it.",4.0,-1
This is my first keurig and I love it. I use it every day to start off my mornings and it is working great for me. My husband loves it also I can just make him one cup of coffee when he gets home from work. The great thing about this keurig is that it is compact it fits on the counter perfectly in a corner and it has great features and the cup sizes which is great. you can also do tea or even hot coco. This is a great product!,5.0,-1
"I love this Brewer! It's sleek and sophisticated design goes well with other kitchen appliances.It also doesn't take up much space so those with a limited amount of counter space don't be worried. 40 ounces of water can be held in the reservoir at once and heats up in 3 minutes or less. For those on the go this is great for fast-paced mornings, it is also easy to use and it's touch screen gives you step by step directions. You can also control the strength of your coffee and I personally like my coffee weak so I'm glad I am able to dictate that. Overall wonderful product, Keurig pulled through with this one, allowing me to skip the coffee shop before work!",5.0,-1

we purchased a Keurig after vacationing in NYC where our hotel had an in room Keuring coffee maker. We enjoyed the hot coffee in the morning and evening. I like to have a cup at night after dinner.

"The Keurig 2.0 is DEFINITELY an update from the old-fashioned (haha) one. Here is a list of the pros (and very few cons) of the Keurig 2.0: Pros: Screen that tells you what is going on. This is AWESOME for someone who is impatient and skeptical, like me. If it weren't for the screen on the new Keurig 2.0 telling me that it was preheating, I might go into a panic, wondering if I did something wrong. And it is is touch screen. This is awesome. Water amount options. Via the touch screen you can select four (I think the old Keurig machines only had 3) different pour options: 4 oz (for super-strong), 6 oz, 8 oz, 10 oz. I, a coffee fiend, went for the strong-ish 6 oz pour. Add hot water option. Turns out that the 6 oz pour did not fill my mug enough, so I was was pleased that there was an option to add just hot water to your cup. Even after adding hot water my cup of coffee was still really good and strong. I was honestly impressed with the Keurig coffee. Descaling solution. The machine came with descaling solution, which is great because if you want your coffee machine to last, you need to descale it often. A bunch of free pods. The Keurig 2.0 came with a bunch (I think ~30) free pods in all different varieties. Very generous of them! My husband even tried the tea and liked it. Very sleek and compact. This machine looks great on the counter in our small, seminary-housing apartment. It fit in the place I usually keep my blender (which means it is very compact). It fit well below our cabinets, as well. Instruction manual in multiple languages and has lots of good info. Including giving you information about recycling K-cups. And…perhaps my favorite: it is polite. This Keurig is noticeably polite! It says ""Welcome"", ""Please"", ""Enjoy""… etc. Very polite programing, thank you very much. Less dishes. At the end of the day, all you have to clean is your mug. Cons: No Carafe. I was excited about the coffee pot feature of the Keurig 2.0, which will be great when we have guests over. However the Carafe is sold separately, which kind of disappointed me. Froze. Because it is now run by a more complicated computer (because of the touch screen, etc.) this means there is more room for bugs. My machine got caught in a loop and was stuck ""preheating"" for about 10 minutes before I realized it was not really preheating. At that point I unplugged the machine to give it a restart. When I plugged it back in it started reheating right away. So, as you can see, there are very few cons and lots of pros! I will consider giving this as a gift for some upcoming weddings! The product is great.",5.0,-1

"This purchase was of the K200 series. We wanted the zest orange but since that was out of stock we went with the purple brewer. We really like the large easy to fill water reservoir along with included easy install filter. Many different brew size options along with a strong option. This unit came with a upper pin cleaner that makes cleaning the system a lot easier than our older model. Lower portion of brewer lifts out for easy cleaning. Unit has easy to understand and program panel. Our brewer appears to be well built and should last quite awhile with little maintenance as our old system has. Brewed our first 2 cups and thought the temperature and strength of the coffee was very good. One thing we noticed is how quiet it is compared with our older brewer. My wife is thinking of swapping out the 2 and making this our primary system. Yes, Keurig is sending me a couple boxes of pods for this review. But that does not mater. If you open our cupboard above the brewer you will find around 50 boxes of pods. Everytime we think we have settled on one coffee we try another and then find we like that one also. Our company that comes to see us loves the large selection of coffees and teas that we have on hand. In summary, you cannot go wrong buying this or any of the 2.0 brewing systems. We have tried multiple brewers in the past and none compare to this.",5.0,-1

"I love coffee. I can't start my day without it. Dumping the grinds and cleaning the filter of my 4 cup coffee pot several times a day became annoying so the Keurig 2.0 seemed to be the perfect solution. So far I love it. Often I just use it to dispense hot water to make tea (with a tea bag) or cocoa ( I keep a measuring spoon in the can and add 2 tablespoons per 6 oz of water from my Keurig). When I make coffee I use Kcups and find it very easy and much better than dealing with ground coffee. The one thing that annoys me is having to refill the water chamber so often. Once it is a little less than half full I get an error message to refill it, even though there is still enough water in the tank for several more cups of coffee. Overall I am happy with my Keurig. I don't think I will ever go back to a standard coffee maker.",4.0,-1

I wish it came with the K-Carafe. I think it's odd that it doesn't. But I do like the fact that I get a quick easy good cup of coffee in just a min or two and how it doesn't take up my entire counter! Totally worth it!",4.0,-1

I do love this brewer. I had the Keurig mini but wanted a next size brewer with a reservoir. The K250 is perfect for me.

"We bought the original Keurig right after they came out and used it for quite some time. We have the 2.0, and love all of the new features! Pros: Quiet—so much quieter than the first version. Lots more options when brewing. You can opt for a ""strong"" brew, change the amount of water used, or (my favorite) just heat water! Love that feature for brewing tea. This version has a carafe that you can fill with using special pods. I'd love to try this out for brewing a large quantity of coffee, but it was not included with my package. I love that you can descale your machine. We had the original version of the Keurig and this was not something that was mentioned/recommended (if I remember right). Such a great way to keep your machine running great. Cons: The water chamber signals needing to be refilled when it still has 1/3 of the water left in it. At our house, my husband and I drink multiple cups of coffee each day, so it needs to be refilled frequently. The coffee is not equal to a strong cup you'd get from an espresso machine (which is what we used to make coffee prior to getting this Keurig.) But, if you like coffee, don't need a crazy strong brew (even using the strong feature), this machine is quiet, easy to clean, and easy peasy to use. Such a great product (especially when comparing to the original one!).",4.0,-1
"We have loved having a Keurig in our house! My husband can quickly and easily brew his usual 10 oz. of dark roast coffee before heading off to work early in the morning, and I can brew a smaller amount later. No more big coffee pots half-full of unused coffee, and we can easily choose different flavors. This Keurig is extremely easy to use, and brewing time is very fast! I have also used the Keurig to brew cups of wellness teas, and hot cocoa. We honestly have no complaints about this product so far!",5.0,-1
"After upgrading from my Keurig Mini Brewer and having this model for a little over a week now, I have to say that I have yet to be disappointed. I use my new Keurig everyday. I love the fact that I can brew various size beverages with the touch of a button. I like to emphasize that it's a button because my last model had no buttons; you just filled the reservoir appropriately. The sleek new design is also a huge plus. I have a black model and it makes a great addition to my modern looking kitchen. The fact that the water reservoir can hold a decent amount of water is another plus. I live with a few other roommates (I just graduated from college) and they all use it also. We don't have to worry about filling it after or before each use. I think this model is great for everyone. Even if I was living in a dorm, I'd bring it with me. As it stands, it looks great in my medium sized kitchen.",5.0,-1
"I love this keurig! I had the original brewer (which i loved) but it was so big and clunky. The size of this brewer is wonderful, not to mention it doesn't humm loudly like the old one did. Also the touch screen is pretty cool looking! Only complaint is that this brewer requires that you use only Keurig K Cups, so that means no ground coffee in the reusable cup. I personally don't mind it as I always buy Starbucks K Cups, but I can see it being an issue for the coffee drinker on a budget.",4.0,-1
"I am a college student who doesn't have money to spend on outside coffee shops. For a while I was spending a great amount of money on coffee, money that I did not have. I decided to do some research on Keurigs. The K200 series caught my attention, it was small, cute and affordable. I really like that I was able to choose from different colors. Overall I use it as well as my mom. She and I both love how convenient and fast it is. Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review!",4.0,-1
"I drink coffee everyday, and find the Keurig to be extremely convenient. I don't have to spend money everyday at Starbucks and the process of making a cup is easy and quick.

"The hubby and I use this machine every day, and even more so on the weekends. Great, fresh cup of Joe, but I do wish we would've purchased the level above this one as we underestimated our size and frequency use. Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review! You all are the best :)",4.0,-1
"This brewer is by far the most advanced on the market. I was thrilled to see Keurig make alterations to the design to create a sleeker, more compact brewer without sacrificing the amount of storage water (holds 40 ounces of water!!!). This brewer has all the features of Keurig's previous brewers without taking up as much counter space! I love that this brewer allows me to choose how strong I would like my beverage to be and has a separate option for brewing hot chocolate. The touch screen is user friendly and makes changing sizes, strength and beverage super easy! Overall fabulous design, I wouldn't change a thing!",5.0,-1
Love my new Keurig! The only annoyance was the lack of any auto on/off settings. My husband sets our old Keurig to turn on and warm up before work so he can hit brew and go on his way. There is no option for that with the 2.0 k250. Otherwise it's a great machine!,4.0,-1

"I love this Keurig, I have had other Keurig brewers in the past and had a good experience, what led me to purchase this one was that I loved the color...

The coffee is good and hot, I love the different sizes, one more feature I would've like to have seen would have been an auto-off feature as my last one had that. Over all, I am very pleased.

"I use my Keurig every day and absolutely love it. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking to buy a Keurig.

Thanks Keurig for the free pods for this review.",5.0,-1
"This is my first Keuring and I am happy I have it. :) makes it extremely easy to make a cup of coffee. I think I am drinking more coffee at home now that I have one. LOL Before making a cup took many steps. Now all I do it add water, insert the k-cup, select the amount of coffee to dispense, and the machine does the rest. There is a function that makes the coffee stronger, if that is your preference. THE ONLY THING I don't like about it is the fact THERE IS NO ESPRESSO function. Now it did allow me to make 4OZ cup of coffee that was SUPER strong. However it is not like an expresso. If anyone has had Cuban coffee then you know what I mean. All in all this is a awesome machine for any home. If I were you, I would consider investing in one.",4.0,-1

"I love my new Keurig 2.0 K250 Brewing System. I love the look with the water reserve located in the back. However, the reserve has no handle and is an awkward shape to hold.

I frequently drink more than one cup on the weekends and days I work from home and this is an exciting feature for me. I also like the setting that I can make it stronger. This feature has been used often. Lastly, I don't like it has a filter that requires changes after a certain number of uses. I have a water filtration system on my refrigerator that I used with my old brewer and it worked just fine this way. Having to purchase these additional filters is an added expense I will have to figure out how to work into my budget.",4.0,-1
This is great! Heats up in about one and a half minutes. Looks sleek and nice on my counter. You can brew different sizes and strengths. Only con: it said preheating and i tried everything in the manual to find what was wrong because it wouldn't do anything. After looking online I saw that the needle that pokes the top of the pod sometimes gets clogged ( this happened after 12 or so brews). I just unplugged the machine and stuck a paperclip (clean) into the needle and it has worked fine ever since.,4.0,-1

"I was meaning to purchase one for awhile now and so glad that I was able to get my hands on one now! This is such a convenient machine, especially for my husband and I who can get by sharing a cup of coffee a day. We definitely don't need a whole pot of coffee and this allows us to easily make just a cup whenever we want without excess. I love that it brews so quickly and is available in multiple sizes suited to your needs (4,6,8, 10) and it's nice to have the option of getting carafe for it if we decide we want to be able to brew a larger amount. It's also nice to have the ""strong"" option for brewing and I really love that I can now make a variety of hot beverages, including tea in this machine and use the ""hot water"" option for other hot water needs! I do wish that it had the capability to brew a little hotter but for the convenience and all the other benefits it comes with, I don't mind that too much. Some people are unhappy that it rejects K-cups from other companies but being new to the Keurig that doesn't bother me right now and after looking into it, it seems there's easy ways to get around this.

We drink a lot of coffee in our office. We used to use traditional coffee machine and always had leftover coffee in the pot which went to waste because they taste bad afterawhile. So we decided to purchase Keurig. Keurig 2.0 system is perfect because everyone gets to drink fresh tasting coffee that brews instantly whenever they crave for one. In the morning we brew K carafe which serves about 4 people using one carafe pod. Others choose whatever they want to drink and everyone is happy. There are huge selection of coffees and other drinks. This is good because there are some people that prefers hot cocoa or teas instead of coffee. Keurig 2.0 covers everybody.,5.0,-1

"I brought this in for my office to use and abuse. We had the Keurig Elite K45 prior too, but the option to do a carafe of coffee was too perfect for us. Grabbed a carafe from a big box store and started to enjoy hot fresh coffee that stayed hot for HOURS. I am not kidding. In the carafe it was at least 4 hours of hot coffee. Too cool! In comparison to the Elite model, this one was definitely lacking in cup sizes, and for the tea drinkers in the office, the 4 oz or 6oz sizes were just too puny in comparison to the coffee sizes you can get from the machine. Sometimes I think it is almost too smart! I have yet to encounter the dreaded Opps! message, but I really do miss being able to use my own coffee in the reusable pods.

"This brewer is much better than the older model I have which is the single cup brewer that is now over four years old. The water will heat up first so when you do put the k-cup in and hit brew, the coffee will be made right away. The only issue I have with this brewer is the fact that it doesn't brew EVERY k-cup I have. If it doesn't clearly state ""Keurig"" around the outside of the k-cup, it will not work in this brewer. You will get a message on the display reading ""Oops...this cup will not work in this brewer."" Luckily I still have the other brewer and put those cups in that one. Keurig does give you the option of sending them in and they will replace those k-cups, but I'd rather just use them up with the other brewer. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase!

"Latex pillows are the only ones I like or use. Until recently my previous pillows had no loft or firmness options. I assume they were just medium. They got the job done. After ordering the Queen high soft, which was too soft, I decided to give the Queen high firm a try. I was hesitant because of the firm designation. Would it be like sleeping on a rock? Turns out the firmness was no issue. It's not hard at all. I think it's almost just right. Your head sinks into the pillow but doesn't bottom out like the soft pillow. My issue with this pillow is the loft. The combination of the support the pillow provides and the high loft means my head remains too elevated for comfort. It's too high. I'm going broke buying pillows. But.... Queen low firm sounds just right.",4.0,-1

I have had an older version of the Keurig for a long time and it was a lot noisier than this one. I also love how small and compact the 2.0 K250 model is. It fits nicely on my countertop without taking up too much room. It is easy to refill the water and clean and makes delicious coffee! My favorite part about it is that I am able to brew a small cup of coffee for myself or use my new Keurig carafe to brew a batch for a whole group! Highly recommend upgrading to this version its fantastic!,5.0,-1

"I purchased this Keurig because I was first introduced to the Keurig family during my internship, the machine make coffee ""making"" fun and simple. Pop in your favorite coffee pod and wait for no more than a minute and have a fresh, perfect cup of coffee prepared for you. I love my new K250 Keurig and the best part, it's in my favorite color!! As a college student a simple yet fun item is a must have in your dorm or even in your parent's kitchen when you're living at home. I cannot picture my life without my Keurig and I love that it makes K-Carafe sizes, my maker came with a free K-Carafe as an offer for purchasing it, and I couldn't be happier. I can't get enough about telling my friends and family members to purchase a Keurig, even if it's not this particular size, you can never go wrong with any Keurig you purchase!

"We purchased the original Keurig when it first came out, and used it for quite some time. Now we have this version, and are impressed with the upgrades and better features than the original model. Pros: Quiet—so much quieter than the first version. Lots more options when brewing. You can opt for a ""strong"" brew, change the amount of water used, or (my favorite) just heat water! Love that feature for brewing tea. This version has a carafe that you can fill with using special pods. I'd love to try this out for brewing a large quantity, but it was not included with my package. This version is also smaller than the original. Love that saved counter space. I love that you can descale your machine. We had the original version of the Keurig and this was not something that was mentioned/recommended (if I remember right). Such a great way to keep your machine running great. Cons: The water chamber signals needing to be refilled when it still has 1/3 of the water left in it. At our house, my husband and I drink multiple cups of coffee each day, so it needs to be refilled frequently. The coffee is not equal to a strong cup you'd get from an espresso machine (which is what we use to make coffee prior to getting this Keurig.) But, if you like coffee, don't need a crazy strong brew (even with the strong feature), this machine is quiet, easy to clean, and easy peasy to use. Such a great product (especially when comparing to the original one!).",4.0,-1

I only wish that this coffee maker accepted ALL brands other than just those that strictly state they are K-Cups. However, I am happy with the wide selection of K-Cups available online and in-store. Whether you want coffee, tea, hot cocoa, or just a cup of hot water for cooking, this Keurig can do it all. Also, its convenient size makes it perfect for almost any location in the home or office.

I really like the touch screen-- very convenient. We typically use our Keurig when we want a quick cup of coffee mid-day.

"As a college freshman and being a huge coffee drinker, I needed to make that I had a reliable source of coffee each morning. I took the liberty upon myself to buy a Keurig for not only myself but also my roommates. I was going to do it sooner or later so I chose sooner. I bought mine in white and looks great; although I do have to clean it often to keep it white. The Keurig is super sleek and doesn't take up too much room in my dorm. The touch screen is nice and simple. It's really easy to navigate and make different cups of coffee. My dorm mates love it as well because all of us just buy our own coffee and make our own cup of joe in the morning. Though the system reads the K-Cups and only accept K-Cups, it's not much a problem for me since I usually buy K-Cups from the Keurig site. All in all, I love my Keurig. It does its job well and I hope for many cups of coffee to come! Thanks Keurig, for the free pods for this review!",5.0,-1

And there seeems to be a wide variety of pods available for use with the Keurig® 2.0 K250 Brewing System. I have already ordered the caraffee and three kinds of pods to use with it. The only concern I have is that its inability to brew other pods (aka non-Keurig) will limit the consumer and reduce the desire to purchase something that only uses its brand.

"First I have to say I've been a Keurig customer for several years. I have one of the original Keurigs and recently bought a 2.0 K550. I received the 2.0 K250 system complimentary to test and review. This smaller system is great. Its very compact so it doesn't take up a lot of counter space. This smaller version has a water reservoir which is great instead of needing to pour water in for each cup. The screen walks you through set up and is extremely easy to use. You can select from different cup sizes to strengths and even brew a carafe. This also came with a ton of K-Cups to try, the descaling cleaner and the Keurig maintenance tool. I have noticed with these new 2.0 systems, especially with my K550 the needles get clogged about every other day and have to be cleaned with the provided tool. One of the things that I was really impressed with is that I have seen several reviews where people didn't know they couldn't use their existing K-cups with the new 2.0 system. Keurig included a post card that said if you have any to contact them and they will replace them. Customer service doesn't get much better than that.",5.0,-1

My husband, who is under 200 lb--180 maybe--sat in one, and I observed the whole thing twist about, despite all the screws being in securely. The thin connector bars seem weak; do not use them to aid you in getting onto the stool. If these were going to be used on a regular basis, I would certainly return them. Assembly was simple: 16 screws. Shipping took 2 weeks. Then I had to use the manufacturer's website to fill out a form to get a replacement seat, because the base was so crooked that the top of a leg stuck out. The replacement base, which took a week to be delivered from the manufacturer, was not centered in the seat, so the leg was very close to sticking out again, but at least it wasn't crooked.",2.0,-1

I will next try white shoe polish and hope it covers. They are comfortable and stylish, but because I received an already opened package, there were screws and washers missing, and there were no directions enclosed. They are not complicated to assemble, but that was an annoyance. I've never purchased from Hayneedle before, and the price was very reasonable for the two stools, but I do feel like I got the discount version of the deal. I got someone else's return. It was obvious by the condition of the box, which was all taped up with clear plastic tape, and distressed. That item should have been pulled from the inventory - not shipped to another customer - ME. Some of the nail-head studs are a bit skewed...again, another quality issue that is less than desirable. In conclusion, I will say the transaction was easy and the shipping was quick, but I do think quality control should be more carefully supervised. I would probably not purchase from them again, based on this experience. One of the bar stools was obviously new and unopened - the other was obviously previously opened and flawed.",3.0,1

It should have tightened up a little more but it broke instead. I would like to see about a replacement but as it is, it cannot be disassembled to send back.

"This is my 3rd or 4th Keurig coffee maker.  I had a K55 most recently for about 4 years and it began to not work properly.  I purchased a K250 about 2-3 week ago.  Boy am I sorry.  First it took me a week to figure out how to turn it off!.  This coffee maker drips water, does not have the auto shut-off feature (I had read somewhere that it had this feature), has to be filled with water more too often and doesn't have an off/on switch.  Also with the water tank on the rear, it has to be out from under the cabinets in order to pour water in it.  I'm just glad this isn't my first experience with Keurig or I'm afraid I would not try again.  I plan to donate this one to charity as soon as I can purchase another one.",2.0,-1

"I first fell in love with Keurig machines at an old job where a coworker had a machine. It was great because I had a night shift and could get the perfect fix of caffeine when all the shops were closed. When she left and took her Keurig with her I was devastated. The lack of coffee at my fingertips frightened me. Luckily I have since convinced my roommates to purchase the K200 brewing system and life couldn't be better. First off I have to say Keurig themselves are a pretty awesome group. I was using a coupon to purchase this brewer but the color I wanted to purchase was sold out. I emailed support to ask if there was any chance that color might be back in stock before the coupon ran out. Although the dates didn't quite work out their customer support responded quickly and was super friendly. They even gave me a coupon for a free box of pods because I was sad about the color being sold out. Speaking of colors, can I just say how awesome it they have such a variety of colors available! I love pops of color and have always been a little bored by the monotone colors available for basic kitchen appliances. It was super exciting to have the option to choose between so many fun and attractive color choices. But enough about it's appearance, how does this thing work? Super easily! I'm no master chef and often get stressed out thinking about making things in the kitchen. Coffee is one of those things that everyone has very specific requirements about how they want them to taste, and if you don't get it right they're doubly cranky because they lack caffeine. This machine is amazing because everyone can customize the size and strength of their cup of joe. I haven't used it yet but you can brew a carafe for a larger party, or if you really just need all the coffee ever. I love this thing because although I don't work as late as I once did, I'm still on an opposite schedule than my roommates. With a larger coffee pot I would either be faced with drinking old, cold coffee or trying to figure out the science and ratio of water to coffee to brew a smaller batch in those big jugs. It never ended well for me with mostly watery coffee. Now when I roll out of bed mid morning I get the perfect amount of fresh hot coffee with minimal effort. I should also mention I am incredibly lazy which makes this machine a god send, no measurements or leaving machine warmers on for hours or daily clean ups of a pot. The ease of popping a cup in and pressing 3 buttons makes my mornings that much happier. Also no fear of leaving the warmer on and potentially burning down your house is a plus. We once had to turn around in a snow storm to go turn off our old coffee maker. Cleanup with this machine is a breeze! About once a week I wipe down the sides of the machine since coffee sometimes splashes up, and give a good wash to the drip tray. The water tank is pretty small and easily monitored for any potential buildup that would need to be washed out. We use this machine so often I doubt anything has time to build up! The only slight negative I have, is I am a little weary to brew things like iced tea through this in fears of it somehow tasting like coffee. I know the easy fix is to run a cycle or 2 of hot water to get rid of any remaining odors, but as I mentioned before I am lazy and not desperate to have quick iced tea at my finger tips. In my mind Keurig can do no wrong! And although Keurig is compensating me with some k cups for writing this I would gladly tell anyone within earshot about the wonders of this machine! So small it can easily fit anywhere in your kitchen! Fun colors and the fastest coffee in all the land. You will not regret one second of your purchase and might kick yourself for not getting one sooner. Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review.",5.0,-1

"This brewer is an very nice upgrade from our previous Keurig first generation coffee brewer. My wife and I have really enjoyed using this very stylish brewer and even though the temperature of the coffee on the older brewer seemed a tad hotter, the coffee on the 250 is certainly hot enough. We use the brewer every morning without fail and I usually go back for a second cup at 8 ounces although our first cup is always set for stronger at the 10 ounce level.

"This Keurig is the perfect coffee machine. This is my first Keurig, and after extensive research, I found it was the perfect one for me.

I can brew a small cup of coffee, a travel-size mug for on-the-go, and a carafe so I can share. I've had it for a few weeks already, and I use it everyday. The only thing that can be bothersome (however, it is definitely not a big deal) is filling up the water reservoir every time I brew.

I also love the additional size options, including brewing 4 cups at once with the carafe (which I wish came with this model, but I know I can always buy it seperatleyif I wish). The only thing I am disappointed by is that it does not take all Kcups.

My stills arrived quickly and were easy to put together. The first time I sat on one of them I felt something sharp. I really didn't pay attention because I was not able to locate the cause. However later I felt it again and it hurt. I found out that there is a nail inside that you can feel the point when you sit on the chair. I cannot find a way to get into the cushion without destroying the seat to remove this object. The other stools seem to be okay,1.0,-1

"I bought these for my kitchen bar height counter and they were perfect. Easy to assemble, and sturdy. My kids are rough on everything and they are holding up well. The price was great too. One tip I have is when you assemble, don't tighten the bolts all the way. Once you have them all in place, move around, one by one, and tighten one turn and move on to the next one.

"These stools look even more beautiful in person. I absolutely love the way they look. Assembly is super easy and quick. The only negative with these stools are the footrests - the screws are a bit too short I think and low quality, one of the screws simply broke when I was screwing it in, but I used my own screws that were longer and sturdier and it works out well. Some people are saying that the footrests twirl around and move, that is absolutely not the case if you use the screws to tighten them, there is no way they will move after putting the screws in, I think these people skipped a step and that is why they are moving around. Overall, these are great bar stools, absolutely stunning.",4.0,-1

"I've been looking for bar stools for my new home for quite a while. The retail price for bar stools is crazy high so I turned to the on-line vendors which offer them at much lower cost. First, I purchased a different set of bar stools on line at more than twice the price of these. When they arrived the assembly was a disaster. The legs and stretcher/footrests did not fit square. The screws were too small/short. All of the leg bolts stripped had to be replaced with hex head bolts and I had to use larger screws for the stretcher bars. After all of that, the stools were still unstable and a real safety hazard, so they were returned. When I saw these cheaper ones on Hayneedle I was concerned there would be the same problems but I thought for the price I would give it a shot anyway. I noticed a lot of negative reviews for other bar stools which cited the same problems as I experienced. Well, I just assembled these new ones and I couldn't be happier. Everything fit properly and the included bolts and screws worked perfectly. These stools are solid and great to look at, especially given the price. One secret in assembly is to make sure you do not over tighten the legs bolts before you secure the stretcher bar screws into the legs. Leave them semi loose until all the screws have been tightened first. After that you can make the final tightening adjustments to the leg bolts. Believe me, you won't be disappointed with these bar stools. The quality is light years ahead of the others I purchased.",5.0,-1

"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These curtains have elevated my room and I simply love them.  The wonderful thing about them is they are not full blackout curtains but do provide a nice amount of cover from the sun.  After moving into a house where the sun rises on the same side as my bedroom which has been troubling, to say the least.  I have found it hard to sleep.  I work late and have struggled to try to find a balance and keep my circadian rhythm on point.  Blackout curtains are too dark and seem to have the opposite problem of keeping me asleep for too long.  While I really like them, they are also an issue.  I didn't even know that room darkening curtains were a thing and these have been the middle of the road choice that I needed.  They are beautiful and a breeze to hang.  The print is by no means a choice for the minimalist in your life, but I was surprised at just how well they fit into my decor.  I was worried they may overpower my room and make it feel stuffy but it's quite the opposite.  The quality is wonderful and I smile every time I walk into my room.",5.0,-1

Curtains are a must in my home. We live in a large townhouse community in Southern California and our windows are extremely close to the street. I needed something to cover the patio sliding doors. This one is working like a charm so far. The sun is blocked by the curtains with a slight glow around the sides. I would suggest giving more clearance on the sides when you mount the rod.  It for sure does wonders with blocking some sound which is nice when you live in an attached community.,5.0,-1

"I am very happy I was able to review these Lush Decor Insulated Back Tab Blackout Window Curtain Panels. These superior curtains I received at no charge in exchange for an honest review.  The curtains are not only good looking but well made. I have included a picture, to show a HOT summer day.  The curtains completely block out heat and light, I would imagine in the winter, they would block out breeze and cold.  Obviously I will need to get another panel, perhaps two, to make them full.  I love there are two ways to apply the curtain to the rod, using a pocket or the tab, so you are not having to purchase a new rod to get these hung.

The blanket has a classy texture, is light to medium weight in weight, drapes well, washes well, and, better still, is not a dog hair and lint trap.  Between the texture, the color, and the drape, it manages to somehow look elegant, rather than like another weird sofa cover.

They fully block out light with no leaks or bright spots anywhere in the fabric.

"I love my Lush Insulated Blackout Window Curtain Panels! They are so pretty and they do such a great job blacking out the light! We use them in the living room and it does such a good job with keeping sounds out and keeping the room dark! They were so easy to put up and I love that they can just be pulled right open when I want to look out and let some light in, but I love that when you close them, they keep the sound out and the light out and they are so stylish! They are very well made, the material is fantastic it's like a microfiber material! We love our red ones, they match so well in the living room and look so good! I have had several friends tell me how much they love them and how good they look! I have recommended it to friends and family and I plan on buying more for the rest of the house!

The curtain is great, keeps the room cool in the hot weather, makes my room look very nice the material is like silk. Curtain is great for everything that I need and more, privacy, energy efficient which my window needs, thermal insulated, noise reduction which I need where I live, and all these things are important to me and the one thing I like the best is that it is machine washable.

"Very impressed with the quality of the pad, it is thick, firm but comfortable, and feels like leather! The stool is well-balanced and bottom cusion pads were already attached to the bottom of the legs. The wood is well-milled and instructions were excellent. Packaging was excellent.

I recommend that you attach the legs in the order shown in the instructions, but only attach them loosely, just good enough that they wobble in place because you need wiggle room to slip the rungs in.

The only problem I see with quality is that the rungs appear to be slightly off-angle where they are supposed to touch the legs. For this reason, I recommend that you attach the rungs in the order listed in the instructions, but in addition I recommend that you use a good wood glue in the rung holes and use a good standard electric drill to attach the rungs securely with the screws to pull them tight into to the holes in the legs (the wood of the legs is hard enough to withstand a powerful drill, but likely not hard enough for an overly powerful drill only because of the size of the notch).

Next, tighten the tops of the legs to secure the legs. The upper legs require the hex tool provided to tighten, and I was able to hand-tighten securely enough that I do not believe they would ever loosen given that the hardware included a grip washer.

I believe the advice I am giving is likely the reason that others claim the stools are bad quality because they likely didn't secure everything as well as it should have been done.

These bar stools are heavy and they are more solid and sturdy after assembly than the more expensive high-end bar chairs I own!  Do not be afraid to purchase these stools! They are a VERY GOOD VALUE FOR YOUR MONEY!!!",5.0,1
"I have searched for over six months for bar stools between 24""-26"" in height that matched my kitchen with no luck. I had settled on some swivel stools but luckily my order was cancelled by walmart due to them being on backorder which was when I ""settled"" for these. I wanted something that didn't stick out from under my island, stools that were padded for comfort, and stools that offered a pretty good size seat for larger people. The leather is a deeper brown than pictured (which was great for me). They were not complicated to put together. I ordered three and NONE arrived damaged and was well packaged. And they seem extremely sturdy!",5.0,1
I would like the wood to be in a lighter brown but otherwise I am happy with them.  The seat has good support and is comfortable.  I like the grid pattern on the seats and the dark red was just the right shade of red I was looking for.  The height fits perfectly under my kitchen counter.,4.0,-1

"Let me start with a positive, I gave it 2 stars because they are definitely a beautiful stool. That's where it ends. Once put together they are not a sturdy stool (they were put together exactly as the directions stated, and I've put together many other pieces from Ashley without incident) when you sit on the stool the cushion sinks right into the wood, the padding is less than adequate, let me state that I'm not a heavy person. Unfortunately I will be returning these stools.  I have since purchased new stools from a different vendor where they come pre-assembled.",2.0,-1

"After reviewing slipcovers online and reading many reviews, I ordered this item. Imagine my surprise when I found it absolutely doesn't fit my recliner, even though I measured to be sure. The back section fits. The seat and leg lift do come close, but there's no way to secure it at the back of the seat. The elastic just isn't enough to do the job. And the arms!!!! There's no way they fit. You can get them on the arm, but they do not reach all the way down and there's no opening for the handle on the side of the chair. I ended up keeping it because the back of the chair has worn out and this fabric matches the leather almost perfectly. After looking at other slipcovers online, they were more than I wanted to spend and who knows if they'd fit any better. Looked at fabric store to make it myself, but couldn't match the color and making the entire slipcover was cost prohibitive. Don't do it.",1.0,1

Just make sure the loops of elastic are on the back to go around the feet in back. The slit for the recliner handle on the side is sewn shut. Just pull the two tabs apart and cut the middle seam. It comes right  apart up and down the sewn seams. Make sure you start with the left arm in back and go around the recliner handle. Have recliner open and then put around top and front. It goes so much easier that way. LOL   I have a nice sized recliner. Not too big, but not small. It has room to spare in the cover.",3.0,-1

Product is of good quality but the assembly needs improved. I am a semi professional with lots of experience on assembling furniture. The attachments of the seat to the legs is very good and solid but the screws used to assemble the rungs to the legs is very poor. To start with the screws are cheap and will break with to much pressure. You can not get enough pressure on the screws to tighten up the rungs so they are not loose. I ended up replacing the screws and gluing the rungs when I assembled them. Once I completed the assemble the stools are good and look nice in our kitchen. Just if you are an unskilled DIY person these stools will be a challenge to assemble right.,4.0,-1

"I have a comfy old recliner that I got from my Mom sixteen years ago - and I love it! It is just right for me - except it is upholstered in baby blue, so doesn't work in my cranberry-cream-and dark green room. I have had several slipcovers for it - and never been entirely satisfied with any of them; either they don't stay on the chair (the most common problem), they don't wear well, or I don't like the feel of the fabric. This slipcover finally changed all that! I love the multi-piece design - it went on easily and it stays put. It's washable, which is a huge plus - and the fabric is cool and comfortable. The color is true to the photo online and is perfect with my decor. Thank you so much! I have already recommended both your site and this product to friends.

I was very skeptical about how good they will be since they were rather inexpensive but was for a big surprise when I received them. Very sturdy, vinyl looks actually good and I prefer vinyl since no animal was harmed, silver studs give very rich and modern look. They look amazing in my kitchen. Even my husband approved lol and he is hard to please when it comes to furniture. I had no issues with putting them together, no problem with holes aligning with screws , they are not wobbly at all. I am very pleased with that purchase!!!!
Thank you Walmart",5.0,-1

"Please Save ur Self tbe hassel 

This is a total waste of money
I can't belive i wasted $150 for nuthing!!!!

 This matress sinks as soon as u place it on the frame 
an
It sinks in many different places
Making This futon matress very uncomfortable to
Sit or sleep on
This is not a normal every day futon matress that you usally see for sale in most stores for sale
So
I bought this futon matress thinking it would be thick an comfortable to sleep on for my daughter 
It was the worst matress we have ever purchased
First off
They use some kind of a filler
Similar to the filler used
For a flimsy bean bag chair
The so called futon is not supported in the inside wit any kind of padding wat so ever like the usal futons are made
Which are usally soft wit think padding for support
It feels like ur layong on tiny little connton balls 
I actually had to buy a box spring to place under the futon so it wouldint sink through as much wen my daughter layed on it
I really wish i could return this so calledd futon matress but the box is so huge an wide it barley fit through my appartment door an would be a even huger hasel to return itt so i guess i jus lost $150 dollars for nuthing",1.0,-1

This Mainstays 5” white wave pottery is so cute! We have a shallow mantle and this fits perfectly. I try to buy ceramic pots because they last year after year. And the contemporary design fits in well with our decor. The other thing I love about this pot is that it has a predrilled hole in the bottom with a plug. Having to drill a hole in a pot is hard to do so glad this one just needed a stone to let water drain.,5.0,-1

I've bought fabric protector and sprayed all my outdoor fabric.  In this hot Auburn sun nothing will save from fading.  I'm tired of spending money on cushions and getting 2 years most (one year one side  the other side the second) I looked all over and everything is 3 times the price.  They seem a good deal.

It fit the smaller one with material to spare that is easily tucked in to make it look custom fit, and looks like the recliner was made in the material, which is very soft and stretchy. The extra large recliner fits great everywhere except the back of the recliner where you can see about 2 inches on each side at the very bottom of the old material. Good thing the back is facing a wall..;) overall for the price I have 2 new looking recliners that really look good. Neither of my recliners were old, but they both are in the entertainment room where my daughter and her friends hang out on the xbox, laptops, etc, and they just looked scurvy, no matter how much spot cleaning you do. Also, the smaller recliner is leather but both were easy to fit, are snug and look great. (with the exception of the huge recliner with a little material showing in the back.)

I gave it 4 stars overall because I didn't end up having to return it even though its a little odd fitting. I bought the yellow one which surprisingly covers the ugly flower pattern that was on the chair.

These cushions are too thin and after using them a few times they all got a permanent indentation in them right in the middle of the seat.  The chairs they are on are solid so it's not due to the shape of the chair.  Now if it rains the seats fill with water and have to be tipped over to pour all the water out.  They are also very uncomfortable since they are so thin.  It's like sitting on the metal chair.  I will definitely spend a little more next time and get better quality cushions.,1.0,1

"I bought the 7' 10"" x 9' 10"" ivory rug.  It was discounted quite a bit, and was actually less expensive than the next smaller size.  I love that it's so soft, and is quite thick.  It doesn't pack down when walked on...so far.  A couple of things for buyers to be aware of...(1) the rug I received has a tan/black woven backing.  The backing is very stiff, and after two days of weighing the edge down it still sticks up enough to trip on.  (2) The black backing shows through in tiny spots, depending on how the pile is mussed.  It isn't a problem, and doesn't detract from the look.  Other people may just be more picky than I.  (3)  There is only one edge on the rug where the pile goes all the way to the edge.  It's almost an inch away from the edge on one side.  The pile is actually long enough to cover to the edge in those areas, and is not a problem for me as the room I put it in is quite small, most of the edges are covered by furniture, and I have the good edge facing the entry to the room.  It would be a problem for someone in a larger room that has the rug in the center and you can see all sides.  Despite those small issues, it's a really nice rug.  Very soft and looks like it will hold up for a while.  I think it's a great deal for the price and I'm glad I bought it.",4.0,-1

"I have been shopping around for a rug for our newly renovated living room. I compared extensively on Wayfair and Amazon. I wanted a rug with some plushness but not retro shag-like. I also was looking for a rug in a “marine” or “ocean” blue to go in my Cape Cod themed room. I finally decided to take the plunge after reading over 400 reviews for this rug on Wayfair. The rug is identified as “Parrish” by Charlton Home collection on the Wayfair site not “Malibu” by Nourison as the rug is identified on the label and attached documentation. The pictures on both the Nourison and Wayfair sites are the same. The color representation is pretty accurate with it appearing slightly lighter in bright natural light. There are a variety of blue shades that blend beautifully together for a deep tonal color. The carpet is very soft and plush but I did place a .25 inch felt pad underneath primarily to prolong carpet life and protect my investment. The only reason I cannot give it 5 stars is because of the measurements. My room is 12 ft and the carpet is 12 ft and about 3 inches; it was suppose to be 12 ft. The other side's measurement of 9 ft is accurate. Luckily, the furniture will hide the overage but we considered returning the rug due to the measurement being inaccurate. If it had been a smaller item, I would have. It is not a cheap purchase and I was hoping it would be perfect.",4.0,-1

So I ordered one from the website hoping WalMart would take some care shipping that one single item. I was wrong.

When I first open the lid the smell was wonderful. Very fragrant for smells like men's cologne. It's amazing! How ever; the scent is best for a smaller room not like a living room.

The candle burned evenly and it gave a perfect soft glow in our bathroom. The scent escape the bathroom into the hallway but it was very faint the further away from the candle you got.

"This little food chopper has been a great help to me.  It was easy to put together, easy to use, and easy to clean.  Sometimes a larger appliance is just too much work when you just need an onion or two chopped or a small amount of vegetables to puree.  This is small enough to fit easily in a cabinet or even leave out.   Easy to hand wash the bowl, cover and blade, or pop in onto the top shelf of the dishwasher.  I also like how the cord wraps around the base for storage. Very glad I got it and even a little suprised how many times a week I use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5.0,-1
"I couldn't get the size I really wanted. I washed the sheets and got a STRONG petroleum kind of smell even though the label shows they are cotton.

"This manly indulgence candle smells absolutely amazing. I love that it doesn't burn fast, but once it is lit the smell is faint and really not noticeable if I burn it in my living room unless I am sitting right next to it.

"I absolutely love this Manly Indulgence candle in 5'oclock shadow scent. I can't believe they captured what my husband smells like, even he noticed. The scent is subtle and naturally blends into to the room, like fresh air on a cool day with the window open. A light hint of clean laundry, mens woodsy body wash, a pinch of a piney fire and citrus. It doesn't make me sneeze or overwhelm the house with perfumes. My husband opened it and said ""smells like me, this is the scent for our house you have to buy more"". I am very pleased with this Manly Indulgence candle, clearly alot of effort and thought went into making a better quality candle.

"Purchased during the pandemic 2 weeks ago this chopper in the onyx black color to match the diamond onyx black color blender. Saw an excellent youtube video with 3 other mini competitors & this one beat all three in terms of ease of use, ease of cleaning, ease of getting the right chop or puree & it didn't leak when oil was drizzled into the top drain hole. I like the store away cord that fits at an opening towards the motor bottom. The stainless steel blade easily comes out when you need to clean it by pulling it straight out. The black lid attaches to the container by a hinge at the widest part and after cleaning and drying well, goes back together without a problem & you will hear it click or snap into place. I made tonight a Greek Goddess Dip recipe & the chopper handled the scallions, garlic & 4 kinds of herbs with some lemon juice without a problem. It pureed everything & then I added the Greek yogurt & low fat mayonnaise. Drizzling the EVOO was simple & a person has to go slowly with the drizzle so the hole can gently drop it into the contents to emulsify well. Thanks for a great mini chopper. Will recommend to all and it would make a great housewarming gift for someone or shower gift to a bride.",5.0,-1

"This is a 16.5 oz soy-blend black tuxedo candle.  It has notes of white musk, lavender, and cedarwood.  This candle is in a black matte glass jar, and comes with a lid.  The thing I do like about soy-blend candles is, they seem to have a longer burn time.  This candle was lit for more than five hours straight and I was surprised to see it had barely burnt a dent into it. I do like the scent of this candle, but I do wish the scent was more fragrant.  I barely even smell anything when it's burning.  I even asked my husband and he couldn't really smell anything either. It's a good scent but a very faint scent, I would have liked for it to be more fragrant.  One other thing I want to point out is the front label.  The label is all wrinkled, it's not aesthetically pleasing to me. Overall, this was okay for me.  I like strong scented candles.  I'm still burning this one and it's sets a nice evening ambience.

Second use and the conclusion is that it is simply very poorly engineered and is not user friendly.  Getting the machine to chop requires fitting the lid into slots and then twisting shut.

Upon receiving this candle it looks like it's packaged very well. Looks upscale and feels it as well.  The scent when uncapped fills your senses with a nice masculine scent without being fruity or vanilla.  This scent portrays a manly presence and scent that I'm proud to keep in my man cave for hanging out and making it an inviting place.  The scent offers a mild scent and the flame is just right without being annoyingly large.

"I really don't feel that this is a manly smell. I was thinking that it would smell more like aftershave but it doesn't it has a smooth smell oh, that is not overwhelming.

"Let's face it, finding a masculine but good smelling candle that doesn't make me look girly is hard. I truly enjoy decorating my home and making it reflect my personality. However, candles are something I usually don't get to incorporate because the stands are all very floral fruity and the colors are geared more towards women. Almost all candles are pink purple bright yellow and those are just not within my masculine black on Grey color scheme. I have purchased several manly looking candles in the past got them home and they smell like a pine tree which I'm sure is great for some but not for me. This manly Indulgence candle is exactly what it claims to be, manly and indulgent. The scent fills the entire room without being overbearing or of a choking quality. It's light but substantial sent filled my entire living room within minutes of lighting it. And that knife matte black Candle container looks great with my manly decor.

"This is a great quality candle. The first thing that I did was smell the candle unlit and it smells manly, but in the most pleasant way. It smells like they could bottle up the scent and make it into an expensive cologne. I also like the jar. It is heavy and is black. I have burned this candle everyday since I have received it. It is not looking like it is going to be halfway done soon either. When burning, the candle has enough aroma to completely fill a small room. The scent it gives a room is one that is very desirable as well. I was unable to pinpoint exactly what the scent(s) of this candle are. However, you definitely will not be disappointed.

It seemed to have a little less scent when it was burning, but it was still there just as a little tickle, not overwhelming like some candles can be.

They are, imo, plenty thick - not so easy to wring out with one hand like some washclothes.   For some people it may come down to pretty vs practical and durable.  I'll choose the latter.

Hello Reviewers!!! Queen Reign here I just wanted to leave my thoughts with you in this Bachelor Pads candle and let's just say it's amazing!!!! So I'm sensitive to smells so most candle brands I can't use it's just too strong but I still want to enjoy a lit succulent candle and fragrance. This one was surprisingly incredible!!!

"The towels are good. They have enough fluff.
BUT! The Better Homes and Garden towel is a much better buy. The Martex are $10.00 per towel. I purchased the Better Homes and Garden Extra Absorbent at the same time for $4.93 per towel. The Martex color was more vibrant. The BH&G has a slight greyish tint. I liked the tint, it is a bit more sophisticated, and the towel is fluffier than the Martex.

Very easy install, popped in the inner glass casing (came bubble wrapped individually) and screwed in my own Edison elongated bulb all under 5 minutes.

"Having heard about these man-geared candles for a while, I was very curious to try one out. This being one of the featured candles in a search for these and having interesting looking notes....I wanted to try this one out. The notes and the name confused me a bit at first because I didn't tie them to the Cuban influenced name. Once I gave it a smell on cold, I understood. It definitely reminds me of smelling a cigar. Not a lit one, mind you. Just opening a humidor and giving it a whiff. Then the name made sense. I loved it. The burn was solid, and the wax pooled out pretty well. It also has a moderate throw. I feel like you don't want this kind of fragrance to be too strong. It seems to hit the sweet spot just right. The design of the candle with the dark glass and the style of label also evoke a certain sophistication, like it belongs in a study. I would recommend!

"I purchased some similar lights for Halloween and was looking forward to these. First, I got an email that they were delivered but the tracking number wasn't for my order. I contacted the seller, who provided me with a new number, and they did show up, but keep that in mind. There's a lot of poor reviews of this vendor. It's hard to tell if they're scammy or just poorly managed.

The lights themselves are not quite what I expected. The snowflakes shine a warm golden but are much smaller than I anticipated. 2-inches across max. 

The construction is a bit iffy. This is especially noticeable in the battery box, which is a pain to open.

The batteries, 3AAs, don't last long either. I use the same rechargeables in all my lights, and this strand sucks them up SUPER fast. They start to dim after just a few hours.

I must say this candle smells really good. My wife is usually not a fan of man scented things but she likes this because it doesn't smell like cologne was sprayed all over the place and it's not a strong smell. The scent is a great compromise to both our preferences. I wish they made a cologne in this scent. The candle is made of soy and burns nicely and not too fast. I love the elegance of the black glass combined with the label style. If you like those strong scented candles, I would pass on this scent.

The Ivy League candle is a slow burning scented candle that we use in our home. If you know Drakkar from the 80’s then you know the scent of this candle. I’ll have to say though it’s not really strong. We light it in our kitchen/family room which is about 1000sf and it’s not too noticeable. But it is very slow burning therefore will last is quite awhile. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],4.0,-1

I have received many compliments on how good my house smells. It's not overwhelming at all. I did buy the 16.5 ounce and am so glad I did. I have burned it for about two weeks every day for about an hour and it's still over half full. It's a big nice sized candle. When it's not burning it looks pretty elegant sitting on my end table.

I use on a wooden chair not only is it eye appealing but most comfortable also. What is wonderful about non-slip cushions is that that stay in place if with movement in the chair.

"OK. 5 stars may be high, but it is what it is and makes no bones. The color is perfect. Perfect size. It is not a ""real"" quilt, but that's why I bought it. Stitches are heat-fused, not real thread. This is great for me, because I have 2 small pets that sleep at the foot of my bed. They cannot catch their toes in loose threads with this spread. When a product is exactly as described at a low price, that merits 5 stars in my book. Is it a fabulously heavy quilt that is super well made, like you would get from a premium bedding store? If you have to ask that, you probably should be shopping at such a store. This is a good, serviceable spread, oversized, and a good color. It's also reversible! Bonus!",5.0,-1

"These are very nice chair pads. I bought them I got these Sweet Home Collection Memory Foam Honeycomb Non-Slip Back Chair/Seat 16"" x 16"" Cushion Pad to go with my wooden kitchen chairs. they definitely look nicer with the pretty blue cushions. I have had them several weeks now, and they have gotten a lot of daily use. I just wipe them off with a damp cloth when needed. (they get used daily by my grandchildren who are still at the age to spill) I do agree with some of the other reviews that they are not extra comfy, However in my humble opinion, they do not even appear in the photos to be thick enough to warrant such coziness. They certainly make a huge difference in sitting on one or not. So I am very satisfied with my purchase of the chair pads. They are holding up quite well under a lot of usage. I would be purchasing again. They are just what I expected and needed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5.0,-1

The non-slip backing is great as well, as we don't need to tie them to the chair backs as we did with our old cushions. These cushions are a bit wider than we've had in the past however. They don't hang over the seat, but a smaller chair they might. In the end, highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5.0,-1

"At first, I was a bit leery with the size of the Sweet Home Collection Memory Foam Honeycomb Non-Slip Chair Cushions I tried for this review.

More importantly, the pads hold their shape in use and spring back to their original shape after you rise up.

This Modern Sleep mattress is just amazing! After one night of sleeping on it my wife and I both got up in the morning without any back pain. This was not the case after sleeping on our previous mattress which cost 10X more than the Modern Sleep mattress cost. Our previous mattress was a name brand orthopedic 3 piece mattress set that was supposed to support your body so that you did not get up in the morning with aches and pains. It did not perform as good as this Modern Sleep mattress. This Modern Sleep mattress is a firm mattress so you do not sag while sleeping. The innersprings are individual coils wrapped in fabric. This advanced technology allows you to move around or roll over without disturbing your sleeping partner. The pillow top with layers of cool gel memory foam is not only individually supportive to each of your body parts it also breathes so that you will not sweat as much as you would with other types of memory foam. I had this mattress delivered to my house and I was surprised as to how it came. The Modern Sleep mattress comes compressed. It was delivered in a 14” x 15” x 5'-6” box rolled up like a piece of carpet (see video). After unboxing we took the rolled up mattress to the bedroom and set it on our existing box spring. The next step is to remove the layers of plastic wrap that is keeping it rolled and compressed. Remove the first layer of plastic wrap and unroll the mattress. Then cut the vacuum sealed bag and it blows up to full size right in front of you. The instructions say to allow the mattress to expand for up to 48 hours so it can return to its original shape. We live in Phoenix so it's hot here and the mattress was ready to sleep on in about 5 to 6 hours. One thing to note is that this Modern Sleep mattress does not come with a foundation. So throw your old mattress away and keep your existing box spring to support it. On top of everything else this mattress comes with a 10 year limited warranty (3 full years and then 7 years prorated). If you are in need of a new mattress you cannot go wrong purchasing one of these based on price and quality!,5.0,1
"I wasn't sure what had arrived on our doorstep in a tall, heavy box. Since it was very heavy -- about 100 pounds -- we decided to load it on a dolly. We got it inside and it turned out it was our rolled-up mattress. We cut off the plastic carefully from the bag it was compressed and rolled into, and out popped the Modern Sleep Pillow Top 14"" Hybrid Cool Gel Memory Foam and Innerspring Mattress.

We flattened it out and let it completely expand itself to its full size, which is just under 14 inches tall. The base is about 9 inches tall, and includes the springs. The pillow top layer is nearly 5 inches tall. They are connected, and the mattress would need to lay on a flat surface, not just a regular metal bed-frame alone, but would need a box spring (with or without springs), or something like that to work comfortably. The fabric it's covered with is pleasantly soft, so if the sheets get pulled off a corner, it's not uncomfortable. There are two strong, fabric straps well-sewn into each side, which is really nice and helpful for moving it.

The mattress is easily the most soft and comfortable mattress we've ever owned. It's supportive yet giving wherever I need it, and works very well regardless of how I am sleeping. It also remains soft, comfy, and cool throughout the night.",5.0,1
"I have been needing a new mattress for quite some time as my old one was as hard as the floor. Due to a back injury, I cannot lay flat or on real firm surfaces. I was so excited to be able to choose this mattress to review. First, I will say you will need help in getting it in your house and to your room as it weighs 106 pounds. It is packaged quite well. It is compressed and rolled up which makes it easy to get in the house and in your bedroom as long as you have 2 strong people. My daughter and I had to place it on a blanket and slide it through my house because we were unable to lift it. My husband brought it inside with a hand truck. However, once we got it on the box springs, I cut the plastic off and the mattress expanded quickly to full size. Be prepared for a smell as the foam mattresses have a weird smell to them that usually goes away in a few days. They just need to air out a bit. There are ""handles"" on the sides of the mattress to grab for easy adjusting and moving. The mattress itself is beautiful, soft, and so very comfortable to lay on. I had to try it out right away so I laid down on it. My 16 year old daughter also laid on it and I couldn't tell she even got on the bed. You can move and not disturb the other person. The coils in this bed are encased in separate pockets so they can contour precisely to your body. Individually wrapped coil innersprings move independently and reduce the sensation of movement. The pillow top is so soft. It gives you a soft cushy feel with just the right amount of support your body needs. I was able to fit my satin sheets on this mattress perfectly. They have 15"" deep pockets that are made for pillow top beds. This mattress is 14"" high. My standard queen fitted sheets won't fit so keep that in mind when considering this mattress. The cool gel foam helps keep a cooler sleeping surface which is good because I always get hot at night. Overall, I am absolutely thrilled with this mattress and I recommend it to everyone who hates firm mattresses.",5.0,1
"Our first night on the Modern Sleep mattress was one of the best nights rest we have had in ages. We didn't find that there were any pressure points while lying or sleeping and both of us woke with no back or neck pain, and with the individually wrapped innerspring coils we didn't disturb one another by moving during the night. Dare I say it is like sleeping on a cloud!
This isn't our first mattress from Walmart.com that came compressed in a box. Our first was a Slumber 1 - 10"" Tight Top Extra Firm mattress that has been superb in comfort and quality but sadly is no longer available, however, our new Modern Sleep Pillow Top 14"" Hybrid mattress is by far superior to the Slumber 1.
First off the Modern Sleep mattress is a pillow top that is filled with gel-infused memory foam that gives you a cooler nights sleep than traditional memory foam as well as a layer of comfort foam for a total of 1 3/4"" pillow top layer. Under the pillow top there is another 1"" layer of gel-infused memory foam followed by another 3 layers of comfort foam for a total of an additional 3 3/4"" of memory foam support. Under all this you have 8"" individually wrapped innerspring coils that really give you great support. The outer top cover is so soft feeling and one of the great features this mattress has is that each side has sewn in handles for easy moving if needed. This is not a mattress that you can or should flip over, only turn from head to foot and back if needed.
The mattress itself comes boxed and is approximately 5 1/2 feet long and 12"" x 12"" square and weighs a little over 100 pounds. Unboxing was not a problem and setting it up was a breeze (see video) but best done with 2 people.
Please don't be turned off by a mattress that is compressed or shipped in a box. It is amazing how quickly they do expand and the quality of this mattress. It also comes with a 10 year warranty so how can you go wrong.
We did NOT notice any ""odd"" odor from the mattress we received but I do know some memory foams can give off a certain smell for a while. Please take note that Modern Sleep advises that you wait 48 to 72 hours before sleeping on the mattress for it to fully expand. Our first mattress, the Slumber 1, we slept on the first night and have had no problems however with the Modern Sleep we waited 72 hours before using it.",5.0,1
"Wow is all that can say to describe this mattress! It comes rolled up in a box that is about 5 feet long and weighs around 100 pounds. When you open the box and follow the instructions you roll out the mattress which is compressed to only a few inches thick. At that point t you can cut open the package sealing it. That's when the fin began it started to instantly grow and ends up being over 14 inches. I was amazed watching this grow back to size. The mattress does have a smell to it after opening but this does go away. The mattress is so comfortable and conforms to your body. I have had amazing nights sleep on this. My husband woke up the first night and felt awesome he also noticed that he was taller, his spine had streatched out from the bed conforming to him. We've been sleeping on it over a week now and I love it. I must warn you though that purchasing the low profile box spring is a good idea if you have pets who sleep in bed with you. The mattress with out normal boxspring is pretty high but don't let this deter you from purchasing. This is an amazing mattress!",5.0,1
"I love this bed!  So extremely comfortable.  I'm a side sleeper but with this bed I'm comfy on my back, side or stomach. 
There was no odor at all after I removed the plastic covering and it expanded to full size in just a few hours. I'm impressed and extremely happy with this purchase.  I was skeptical of purchasing a mattress online.  After researching and finally reading reviews I decided to order it. So So happy I did.",5.0,-1
"We were extremely happy to receive this mattress. Absolutely fantastic bed. We previously had a King size mattress that was very old and uncomfortable so we desperately needed a new mattress. The Modern Sleep Pillow Top 14"" Hybrid Cool Gel Memory Foam and Innerspring Mattress is a great mattress especially for the price. When the mattress arrived, it was very tightly packaged. When I saw it, I actually thought maybe it was just the pillow top portion and that the mattress was still on the way. Once you cut away the plastic the mattress quickly absorbs air and instantly expands to full size so you will want to open it wherever you plan on keeping it. It is much easier to get through doorways or staircases while it is still compressed. It does however say it may take 24 to 72 hours to fully expand. We found that by the second night it was perfect . I would not consider this a firm matress by any means yet is is very supportive. It's kind of hard to explain until you actually lay on the matttress, I would say it is more on the soft side. The innersprings in the bottom 8 inch portion of the mattress offer plenty of support but the top potion with the memory foam and gel and in the pillowtop is very soft and contours to your every curve. It feels like heaven and is extremely comfortable. When you lay on it your body sinks down into the memory foam a bit. The memory foam top also isolates movments so it does not transfer to the other person sleeping on the other half of the mattress. My husband loves this. We have a 6 week old baby so I am constantly getting up throughout the night and now with this new mattress I don't wake him every time I get out of bed. I can even rock the baby as I sit up in the bed and he is able to stay sound asleep. Previously both my husband and I were waking every morning with lower back pain because of our old mattress. This mattress has completely resolved that issue. I just wish I had this mattress sooner during my pregnancy as it would have saved me a lot of pain and suffering. I also love that it kees you cool at night. I have not woken up in a hot sweat once yet since having our new mattress. I normally have to sleep with a fan on to stay cool but the gel infused memory foam dispurses heat and draws heat away from your body. Having a new baby I really need to make the most of the little bit of sleep I get. The bed feels like a dream and I feel like you really get the most bang for your buck. After we received this mattress we just happened to be at the mall in a department store where I layed on a few other hybrid mattresses and the Modern Sleep mattress was just as comfortable but cost less than half their price. I don't know why anyone would pay all that money for a mattress when this one is just as nice. Really a great value on a beautiful matress.",5.0,1
"I have been sleeping on the Modern Sleep Pillow Top Mattress for several days now and I have to say I just love it. I have fractured several vertebrae in my back so a good night's sleep does not come easily. This mattress is great and has just the right blend of good support without being too hard. The mattress is constructed of 8 inches of innerspring coils on the bottom and 6 inches of foam at the top. The foam is of two different kinds so you get the best of both worlds. Memory Foam conforms to you individual body shape but memory foam by itself can retain too much body heat. The brilliance of this mattress is that it combines layers of memory foam with layers of Cool Gel Foam which gives you the comfort without over heating. The innerspring coils on the bottom adds a just little ""bounce"" to the mattress so it does not feel like you are sleeping on a slab.

As I said, I have severe back problems and it is just such a pleasure to wake up and start my day without that ache in my lower back that I had with my last mattress, which I only purchased a year ago. I spent a thousand dollars on that mattress only to be greatly disappointed. The Modern Sleep Pillow Top Hybrid sells for about half that price and is way more comfortable.

The shipping on this mattress seems a little odd at first but is actually a real plus. It comes compressed, vacuum sealed, rolled and boxed. While it is still quite heavy, 110 pounds according to FedEx, the smaller size and shape of the package makes it easy to get through doorways and around awkward corners that some homes have. Once in place just remove the box and the outer plastic wrap and unroll the mattress on top of the bed or platform you are using. Then simply release the compressing by cutting along the edge of the plastic casing. It says the mattress will re-inflate in 24 to 72 hours but mine was full sized in minutes.

I could not be happier with this mattress and I highly recommend it. My daughter is already saying she wants one too!",5.0,1
"First let me start by saying I have slept on the same Sealy Posturepedic bed for a very long time and was looking at new mattresses and had already bought a bed platform when I got the chance to try this out. I also want to state that I have never slept on a memory foam bed even though they have been around for a very long time. I feel this information is important if you are in the market so you can base your opinion off my comments knowing the history. That being said I was surprised that the box arrived and was a cylinder shape but weighing 106 pounds according to the FedEx shipping weight. I would recommend that you have someone help you set it up due to the awkward shape of a mattress and the give it has along with the fact it weighs 106 pounds. I'm stubborn and did it alone but it was a real bear to maneuver it onto the new platform I had. When I opened the box the mattress was cylindrical in shape and a very tight fit so it was hard to get out of the box so I used the scissors that came with my kitchen knives and very carefully cut along an edge to free it. I have shown in stages the removal and setup in the accompanying video I made as well. When you unseal the vacuum wrapped plastic sheeting which is thick, tightly wound and there are a few layers the bed literally seems to self inflate in an instant so be ready and have it on or in the position you require. Mine inflated upside down which was pretty awful seeing I was doing it solo. When they say 14"" they may actually be understating it because some sheets might not be deep enough for this mattress. It is that plush and that deep. When you sit on the edge of the bed the foam immediately gives way and has no rim or edge to keep in structured so I had to get used to the feeling it was pitching me off the edge of the bed and have since learned to sit further back on the edge initially. I also noticed the first night that an average adult when laying in the same position for awhile will eventually sink into the point of feeling the firmness of the springs beneath the foam layers. I was not sure about whether it would be comfortable after a nights sleep so I waited a few nights to write the review. I have always preferred a pillowtop but with some support but figured once I was used to the memory foam this would fit the bill and it does. I find that getting comfortable is much easier and I'm falling asleep faster when I do lay down at night. That is saying a lot because I have a couple of work related injuries on my back from years ago. If I don't have the right balance of soft and support I am like the Tin Man from Oz minus the oil can in the morning and after a week I have had no issues with pain in the morning, I'm falling asleep faster and the foam literally cradles me as it conforms to me when I am first going to bed. If you are like me and have back injuries I would recommend it and if you don't then you'll find it even better to sleep on. I have to say I am amazed because I was looking at Sealy mattresses at twice the price and this is insanely comfortable. Enough so that I ws also looking to replace a mattress on a bed in a spare room and intend to spend half the amount on one of these in that room. It's a great, comfy and economical bed.",4.0,1
I would love to give it 5 stars but before I get into anything else yes the bed.... very comfy however the foot and head part of the mattess is terrible I thought it would fully open up but it hasn't after having it for 6 days now. so when sitting on the end it feels like there is no support. however the sides are great while sitting down.,1.0,-1
"I have to admit, I was a little skeptic about a mattress that arrived in a box all rolled up. But I WAS WRONG. My husband and I are very ""hard"" sleepers, we aren't easy on mattresses. We are also very picky. The mattress is nice and heavy and the fabric on it is so soft. Getting the first layer of plastic off was a bit of a workout. But cutting into that last layer of plastic, the one that let all the air out, was so satisfying. Almost immediately, it swelled up to its advertised size. I left it untouched for 24 hours before putting any bedding or people on it. When I finally laid down on it, I was pleasantly surprised. It's like sleeping on a cloud of perfection. I will forever recommend this mattress.",5.0,-1
"With the combination of its great features, the pillow top, hybrid cool gel memory foam and innerspring, it makes this mattress so amazing. The firmness is perfect for those who are looking for best quality product to sleep on. I was surprised on how comfortable it is and my back doesn't hurt anymore when I wake up in the morning. It's got that cooling effect of the gel that adds to its incredible support for your whole body. Plus, it is so easy to unpack. You just have to lay it on where you're going to put it and roll away. It automatically decompresses once you remove the plastic packaging. The only con about it is that a woman couldn't lift it by herself because it's too heavy but other than that, I love this mattress.",5.0,-1
"I just received the Modern Sleep Pillow Top 14"" Hybrid Cool Gel Memory Foam and Innerspring Mattress and I love it! It comes vacuumed packed in plastic and comes in a small rectangular box that makes it easy to maneuver when picking the perfect spot to put it. I was so surprised when I saw it because I was expecting a way bigger box! Once you unpack the mattress, you lay it flat, and CAREFULLY cut the plastic along the sides. You will then hear a loud hissing noise as the air is let into the mattress and it expands. I let the mattress “sit” without getting on it for 48 hours and it really did rise! It is a lot higher than my regular mattress but it is so worth it! I love the fact that it is firm yet the gel memory foam also makes it soft. The gel memory foam makes it so you feel cooler during the night by drawing the heat away from you as you sleep. I also love the fact that the side of the mattress has multiple little straps that you can hold onto so you can easily move it wherever you want. Bottom line…I would DEFINETLY buy this mattress!! It is a great investment and seems like it will last for years and years! Trust me, this is a purchase you will NOT regret!",5.0,1
"I was surprised to see the Queen-Size, 14"" Hybrid Cool Gel Memory Foam and Innerspring Mattress arrive at my front in a long narrow box. After cutting open the box, and then cutting off the shrink-wrap, the mattress folds out to its full size. Instructions are enclosed as to how to unpack the mattress. It's much easier if you place the unopened box on your bed before starting. I recommend having two people unwrap the package.",4.0,-1
"This mattress I recommend it 100%. In the last years this is the best mattress I've ever had. It is firm but smooth at the same time. Rest very well and you do not wake up tired as in other mattresses. My children love this mattress. You pay less than it's worth. When I received it, I was very impressed by the way I received it. I arrived in a box as if it was a taquito. I thought it was just like a quilt but when it was taken out of its bag the compressed air came out and took its natural form. Do not hesitate to buy this product, you wont regret it.",5.0,-1
This mattress came rolled up in a box. It definitely takes two people to open it and unroll it. You have to carefully cut the outer plastic open period Then enroll the mattress period and then cut the inner plastic off very carefully without cutting the mattress itself and let the mattress lay flat for approximately two days to gain its full height. The mattress is very comfortable to sleep on it is so soft and it fits two grown adults with no issue. The memory foam is wonderful. I never felt my husband getting up in the middle of the night like I used to on her old mattress. This mattress does require deep pocket fitted sheets for a good fit. Standard fitted sheets tend to come off because of the height of the mattress. Sleeping on this mattress is like sleeping on a cloud. It also keeps you cooler on warm nights. Will only be using this type of mattress in the future as it provides great support without being too firm.,5.0,-1
"The Modern Sleep Pillow Top 14” Hybrid Cool Gel Memory Foam and Innerspring Mattress is everything it says it is. The mattress is compressed in plastic, rolled in an additional layer of plastic, and placed in a tall box for speedy shipment. Shipping weight is 108 pounds and the mattress is in fact heavy. If you're in a place that has stairs, you will probably need some help getting the package in your home. Once inside, you can most likely handle the mattress to unpack it. I had no problem rolling and unwrapping the plastic, and then opening a corner side of the compressed area of plastic. After opening one corner, the air begins to release, take scissors and cut gently along that side. You can then remove the entire plastic along each side as the air continues to release. The mattress uncompressed readily and by the next day, it was almost at it's full 14”. The bottom layer of the mattress is innerspring and the top layer is the memory foam. I would say the mattress is semi-firm. The memory foam conforms to your body, whichever way you choose to sleep on it. I have lower back pain and as a norm, if I sleep longer than 4 hours, I literally have to roll out of bed in the mornings. With this mattress, I did not have the lower back pain. With that said, I have not had it long enough to say much in regards to back pain relief. I needed a bed in my small guest house and appreciate being able to sample this mattress as it will be great for guests/friends/family. I did notice the mattress keeps me cool in regards to not sweating. Usually I wake up with the back of my neck sweating but this didn't happen with this mattress. The mattress is virtually motionless which is great to say the least. Additional features besides being attractive, is the handles on all sides which helps in regards to moving the mattress. Presently I am awaiting the Modern Sleep platform bed that will accommodate this mattress perfectly. In regards to sheets, you would use your standard sheets but in regards to fitted sheets, slightly deep pockets is best. It may be time for you to break out of the old mattress sets and give the 'Modern Sleep Pillow Top Hybrid Cool Gel Memory Foam and Innerspring Mattress' a try.",5.0,1
"I received this mattress free of charge in exchange for my honest review of the product. Here's what I thought about it.

I haven't had a good mattress with any support in over 10 years, so it took me two weeks to really get a good feel for this one. My old mattress was a traditional inner-spring that had lost ALL its support. I've been suffering with back pain for years because of this and would toss and turn most of the night. The 1st night was rough, I couldn't get comfortable and that was to be expected since my spine wasn't used to being supported. The 2nd night, I slept like a baby. Literally, I laid across the bed to watch TV at 8:00 pm and woke up the next morning at 8:45 am. It's been like that ever since.

I've slept on pillow top mattresses before and never liked them because you'd wake up in a deep hole sweating like a hog because they'd retain heat and wrap a cocoon of padding around you. Not this one. The Cool Gel Memory Foam REALLY works! I never roll over into hot spots, the mattress stays cool and doesn't give you the feeling of having to try to climb out of a grave in the middle of the night if you decide to turn over. I like how it supports you, without allowing you to sink too far into the mattress. It's firm enough to offer support and also soft enough to carry you off to dreamland. I LOVE THIS MATTRESS!!! I am so glad I got it. I've been waking up refreshed and not feeling like the walking dead every morning the way I did with my old mattress.

You'll have to excuse my excitement in the video I attached. The mattress came in a box, rolled up like carpet and as flat as a pancake. Since they only allow you to attach one video, I'm pasting the link to the video I made of unrolling the mattress out of the box: https://youtu.be/cgd8_NyTNC0
Once we broke the seal on the bag, it was like watching a time-lapsed video of a cake rising in the oven. It was amazing! I don't know what kind of vacuum sealer type equipment they used to get it that flat, but whatever it was is ingenious! The mattress just kept growing over-night. So it wasn't until the next day that it was fully inflated and boy was it HUGE! If you're looking for a mattress and want support, comfort and a pretty nice looking product, I would highly recommend this model by Modern Sleep.",5.0,1
"SUPER COMFORT: UNREAL!! This mattress was more than I expected. I woke up this morning NOT sore, which has not happened for a long time. This mattress is FIRM but gives enough to conform to your body. I'm a heavy person so this was a treat. The mattress does not sink in. The mattress does not feel like I'm sleeping in a valley or on a hill. I have had this mattress for about one week now and I have to say it is awesome. The box was a bit beat up but luckily the mattress was well protected. The mattress is firm, which was what I wanted and I have slept amazing, and the best part is the husband approves too.
The paperwork says that the bed will fully expand to its 14"" height in 72 hours but you can sleep on it immediately. I'm guessing mine was around 7"" - 8"" when I set it up. I am getting a chemical smell as others have mentioned but it's tolerable. I know it will go away soon.
SET UP NOTES: This mattress comes rolled up & compressed, packed in vacuum sealed plastic with an outer layer of thick plastic protection. It is extremely heavy. It is rolled up from head to foot so expect a roll that is as long as your bed is wide. I recommend you first remove your old mattress. Then drag this heavy box ""intact"" into the bedroom. From there open the box and remove the roll. Discard the box to make room. I could not do this project alone. I highly recommend two people. Lift the roll onto your bed, centered across, so that it will fill the bed when unrolled. THEN, carefully remove the outer plastic wrapping. Next, begin to open the vacuum seal plastic. Scissors and a knife will work but you must be VERY careful not to cut the mattress. I found I could PULL most of the plastic apart. The mattress will begin to unroll while doing this. Once all of the plastic is removed, finish unrolling the mattress and nudge into position. It is still quite heavy and tough to move.

I MUST HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MATTRESS. IT WILL BE AN EXCELLENT PURCHASE!",5.0,1
"The ""Modern Sleep Pillow Top 14"" Hybrid Cool Gel Memory Foam and Innerspring Mattress"" is surprisingly comfortable. There's a softness to the mattress because of material used on the top and sides. At the same time, there is a firmness to the mattress as it supports one's body.

The depth of the mattress that I have is 14"". This caused the mattress to rest rather high on my foundation (I used my old boxspring). I loved it. It felt like a real treat to get into bed every night. There is a foundation sold on Walmart.com that states that it is 4"" so that may be a great addition for anyone interested in keeping their bed closer to the ground. For myself, the height is perfect.

Due to the depth of the mattress, sheets with deep pockets (for each corner) may be needed. I happened to have a sheet set that allows for a deep pocketed mattress and it worked well. Initially, I attempted to use a regular (didn't have deep pockets) sheet set and the sheet kept coming up and off of the corners.

Keep in mind that there are others mattress depths available in the Modern Sleep line up of mattresses through Walmart.com. This mattress is the best one I have ever owned.",5.0,1
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] We bought these for our patio bar and grill to match our Frontgate outdoor sofa set.

It came several days earlier than expected - bought it on a late Tuesday night and got it on Friday of the same week. I was a little weary about it not being ""shaggy"" enough but nope, it is perfect! After rolling it out, I laid on it for quite a while and ran my fingers and toes through the rug.

"Received the Modern Sleep mattress to review as part of a consumer program. Upon arrival, I unwrapped the mattress to allow it to expand. I was already impressed with the quality of the fabric on the mattress. The mattress was plush and thick due to the various layers of material from which the mattress was created. I could not wait to allow the mattress to fully expand to see how it slept. Once I put it on the bed, I was amazed at how it compared to my last mattress. This mattress is firm—but in a good way. I have a memory foam pillow, but with this mattress I will have to resort to something a little softer to balance the firmness of the mattress. It does not sway or compromise with more than one person on the bed. Because it is a hybrid mattress, you get the best of both worlds. You get the flexibility of an innerspring, but the comfort and support that goes along with a memory foam mattress. This mattress superseded my expectations. Because this mattress is 14”, deep pocket sheets would be a wise investment. I see this mattress being an investment in my home for years to come.",5.0,1

It cradles and supports your body and as soon as you get up, the memory foam just raises back up!  

As soon as we opened it, it raised right up to full size.  However, we let the mattress just sit and air for about 36 hours and slept on it the following night.  And I can honestly say we haven't slept that good in a very long time.  Best purchase we have made.   We placed the mattress on top of our existing box springs, but as the time is coming to replace the box springs we decided to just buy a smart base bed frame to put the mattress on since that is what we did with our kid's hybrid mattresses and it has worked out great.

Love the color (fresh ivory) And the carpet s thicker than I thought it would be. I've had it for about a week and it is finally starting  to lay flat. My only complaint is that  one whole corner of the plastic cover was ripped from shipping and I took a chance and steam cleaned it and it came all out just fine. Fed Ex was the shipper I 'm sure they did the damage to the cover.  Great carpet so far!!!,4.0,1

"This is a beautiful rug, thick and soft. However, mine is getting little pulls or tufts in it. I have been tucking them down into the rug as I am afraid to trim them off. I first noticed them after vacuuming the first time and am unsure if this caused the tufts, or if my dogs' toenails are causing them, or if the yarn is not secured in the rug properly. I've had hooked rugs before and have not experienced this problem.",3.0,-1

"This item was returned.
I have no idea if it was of good value or not. It arrived by carrier covered in dirt and black grease. The plastic protective covering was completely torn off both ends and the rug was disgusting and smelled. Walmart should have used heavier plastic to protect the rug. The carrier (unmarked Fed Ex vehicle) should have rang the bell and allowed me to refuse receiving damaged goods. Instead she drug it to the door, yes she drug the 8x10 white rug through my grass, up a sidewalk and left it on my doorstep. She didn't ring the bell and tried to drove away fast and wouldn't stop when I waved at her and tried to stop her. I wanted to refuse the shipment or file a complaint with her or something. Bottom line, she knew it was horribly damaged and should have taken responsibility.
Upon returning it to my local Walmart store the sales associate was appalled that it was delivered to us in this shape. She suggested we complain. We did and we also chose not to repurchase from Walmart.com. We went to our local Kroger and paid $20 more for the same rug but this one was clean and packaged properly.",1.0,1

"I wanted to love it. I just can't. It's too hard and it feels like I'm sleeping in a bowl because the heaviest parts of me sink down.  There's no support for my lower legs. I can't even feel the mattress with my legs when I lay on my stomach; it's like my legs shoot UP from the side of a bowl!!   I have to wrap my comforter under my feet to have any support for my calves and feet.  I feel like crying with disappointment. I haven't slept more than a few hours at a time since we got it. I finally fell asleep near 2 am last night and it's only 5:45 am as I write this review. 

I'm currently sitting on the bed. Yes, my butt is comfortable. It would make an amazing sofa if it was a sofa. An adaquate hotel bed because those are never THAT comfortable anyway. But to drop over $500 and be THIS disappointed.  Ugh, I want to cry!!

I feel like it may be a better bed for back sleepers. Because of the weird way you sink in and it holds the back of your knees. But the moment you try to sleep on your side or stomach, your legs feel like they're pointing up.

I feel like these reviews of the people who received them free are slightly biased. Because yes, it IS better than a worn down old mattress or one of those cheap $100 mattresses.  Sure, it's not like sleeping on a rock.  I have no back pain, but I am so completely disappointed in this bed.

You know that heavenly feeling of climbing into bed, especially a new plush pillowtop bed? Well, I had that with a bed 12 years ago. Every night I was so giggly because it was the most comfortable bed I ever slept on. With this bed, it's such a complete let down.... I have a knot in my stomach with how much money we spent and i actually hate it. 

Plus, yes it is cool! When I shift, the mattress is noticeably cool in spots I recently moved away from. My back doesn't get hot.  I just wish it was more comfortable. I going to try to return it.",2.0,-1

"This mattress is excellent, I have three bad disks in my back and stenosis. This mattress is FIRM but comfortable. I had a Serta before this one and it sagged bad after only 4 months. I'm 170 lbs and was shocked that an expensive Serta mattress would sag so bad. It was terrible. But this new Modern Sleep Pillow Top 14"" Hybrid Cool Gel Memory Foam and Inner Spring Mattress is just what I needed. My back pain when I first get up in the morning in not nearly as bad as before. Time will tell how well it holds up and doesn't sag but this mattress seems MUCH better made that the Serta I had before. I tried to get Serta to warranty the mattress and did all they asked including pictures and after all the fuss, they told me they had no reps in the area to come see for themselves and stopped all contact with me. So I will NEVER buy another Serta product. If you are looking for a FIRM mattress and a great price  this is it. BUT... The shipping was very bad on my new mattress. The mattress comes compressed in vacuum sealed plastic but the box was torn so bad that they actually tore the vacuum bag and the only thing left keeping it from flying open was the other thick plastic wrapped around it. So it was a chore cutting open the thick plastic because it was trying to spring open rapidly and causing damage to other objects in the room. So I had to lay it on a open area in the living room and let it fly open without breaking anything lol.. It took about 8 hours for the mattress to take full shape and expand. Fantastic mattress for the money.",5.0,1

I bought this bed with some hesitation because I've never bought a mattress online before. I got it two weeks ago and the first night it seemed a bit hard...but after a couple of days...it began to get softer. I wanted a mattress that cuddled me like a baby and this one does. You sink into it and I love it. My hip and back pain are gone...and when I fall asleep...I don't wake up in all night.

"Wow!   I am in my mid 50's and have been sleeping on waterbeds or futons since I was 14.  This was my first real mattress.  We replaced it as the quality of waterbed mattresses really has gone down hill in recent years (too many leaks).  

So glad we did!   

Given our bedroom is on a 3/4 height floor of our house atop a narrow ""S""-curve stairway, we wanted something that could get up there.  My husband and I are both over 6' tall, so a KING is the only size we can sleep on.  We tested out the conventional ""Mattresses in a box"", but felt like we were laying on a  squishy marshmallow.   A traditional mattress would never get around the bend up to the second floor.  

Then we found this hybrid memory foam / coil spring!  It IS 125 pounds, but two of us wrangled the compressed, rolled  mattress up the stairs.   It unfurled and expanded to near full size within an hour, and we let it ""breathe"" for about 8 hours before putting on the bedding.   The packing odor had completely dissipated by the time we turned in.  

This mattress is EXCEPTIONAL!  So absolutely comfortable!   No sensation other than total support where we needed it!   No motion, no sense of any movement of the bed (like when either you get in or our of bed for a 2AM bathroom call) - all you get is just a PERFECTLY UNINTERRUPTED night of sleep!   

The mattress comes with a 10 year warranty.   Hopefully we will not need to remove it any time soon (though the full mattress going DOWN the stairs would probably be a lot easier than UP).  There are positioning straps on all four sides and two people can easily maneuver the unit around if it needs to be moved.  

JUST ONE WORD OF ADVICE - Make SURE you have the correct side of the mattress facing UP before you let it unfurl...  We did kinda hit that snag but managed to quickly flip it over before it became too big.",5.0,1
"The rug is OK - Not great not bad. But for $80.00 with tax it's a rug I would NOT brag about. I am actually considering returning it. It's just too boring. I know that I ordered it and it is ivory, but the qualtity does not help it stand out. Not horrible, just not that great. Sorry",2.0,-1
I purchased this mattress in Feb 2017. it is now October 2019 and it is going to the trash. it is completely broken down. no firmness left at all. I am 5 ft 5 in 175 lbs so there is no reason for this. I paid $444 for it and see they are asking $900 now. Stay away!,4.0,-1
"This rug is perfect sized for my hallway coming out the bathroom into the bedrooms and it perfectly matches my other Mohawk home area rug in the living room. The issues I have with it are that there were quite a few loose strands when I unfolded it that I gathered and threw in the garbage. In addition, I did online pick-up from Walmart; instead of them rolling the rug, they folded it, so even now after 2 weeks of having it, you can still see the fold mark that's horizontal and the vertical one. Lastly, even after putting something heavy weighted on the corners for a day or 2, 3 out of 4 of the corners still aren't completely flat; in fact, when I go in the linen closet, you either step on the corner and open the door or when you open the door, it will 'hit' the corner and the rug folds back as the door opens.",4.0,-1
"I received it a bit later than scheduled, but I assumed I would due to some harsh weather up here, so I'm not bothered. 
Box was cheap cardboard in awful condition, but mattress wasn't damaged, or the plastic around it. It did NOT explode out of the package like a nuclear bomb, so as long as you're careful cutting the plastic, you should be fine in that regard lol. Beneath the actual wrapped plastic, the mattress is also vacuum sealed, which makes unrolling an easy task.
I do recommend letting it air out for a bit, just turning on a fan for a little while with the door open, because there IS a chemical smell. It's not a bad smell, but it's strong at first.
I am happy to say that the mattress expanded fully within a few hours!!! Or so I thought lol! I came back into the room after another few hours and it was even bigger! The memory foam does take a little longer to expand. Can't feel springs at all. I'm 5'2, 125 lbs and it's firm but I sink in a little in some spots. Might not be firm for those who are a little heavier, but the springs have amazing support nonetheless.
All in all a good purchase. Will update in a few months on how things work out :)",5.0,-1

Set up was easy but I'm not sure about the quality. It's only been out of the box a couple hours but the corners are week and not up like they should be and the sides are week and compress a lot when you sit up unlike other mattress with better support. The bed is lumpy and slopes between the springs. I'm not sure if it needs to sit longer to fully expand or just junk. I actually canceled a bed from a furniture store to buy this as it was cheaper and seamed better but now thinking I made the wrong decision. No paperwork so I'm not even sure who I'd call or what can be done if I'm not satisfied. My otherbed that this replaced was all foam. It is a lot sturdier and less motion.

The only suggestion I would make is to tell them you want it wrapped properly for shipping to the store.

Its really comfortable but its a little hard/firmer then what I wanted. Wish I was able to lay on it or feel it before purchasing online. Its really firm. But hopefully I can get use to it. I don't know yet. Kind of regretting the purchase.,1.0,1
"I use this runner in the kitchen in front of the sink. I love the way it feels underfoot. Thanks to the generous shag piling it's plush and cushiony. I think it would also be great in a dressing area post shower. 
Since the pile is so thick, I don't use the vacuum on it, but take it outdoors and shake it out.",5.0,-1

"We just moved to a new space & needed a quick, cheap solution for a rug in our living room. This high pile rug (it is definitely not a full shag, but more of a high pile) was a steal at $125 with free shipping! It's not an incredibly soft rug, but the color is exactly what we were looking for and if I decide to replace it in a year or so, we didn't invest that much into it. This is definitely the best value for an 8x10 rug that I know of! Just don't expect a luxurious, soft shag. What you'll get is more of a decent high pile (1"").",4.0,-1
"It's a decent rug if you have a more rustic or contemporary look going.  It's basically like a piece of shag carpet with bound edges.  That wasn't the look I was going for, and the colors didn't match well with my furniture, so I returned it.  I was looking for something a little softer/smoother looking.",3.0,-1
"Read all other reviews on this rug before ordering. Had to evaluate color,texture and over all satisfaction buyers remarked on. Well it's my turn... Received rug nicely protected with plastic, and rolled tightly and secured with tape. Revealed a great rug that is dence with no chemical smell or shedding of fiber. I was worried that some of the rippled areas wouldn't flatten out but they have. Color is just the perfect dark camel/tan that's warm and rich, just what was needed for fall/winter transition from spring/summer light grey rug. Really gives warmth to my white on white furniture. Soooo happy!",5.0,-1
"Very nice looking area rug. The shag is an interesting texture that doesn't show wear or pet hair as much as others of similar price point. Needs a thich cusion below to be more comfortable, but has great non-skid backing, so the extra pad is just a personal preference. Note, the taupe is not at all as pictured. It's actually a light camel color.",4.0,-1
"Really do love this rug. So happy with it and it goes perfectly where we have it.
Easy ordering and convenient shipping to nearby store so I didn't have to worry about it being delivered when not a home. Easier pick up since I could get when best time for me.",5.0,-1

This is my 2nd one. I got the 5x8 first and then the 8x10. So nice and it is great for the kids to play on. We have wood floors so we have to have an area rug where the kids can lay out to watch tv. I couldn't have asked for a better rug. Surprising quality for the price. Although I dislike going into this store do to the crowds I ordered this online and am very pleased.,5.0,-1
I bought the runner and small bathroom rug so thick vacuum that is it. Made really well and last a long time.

"These rugs are American made and the fiber is tough yet does not hold water. They are fast drying after cleaning and stain and chemical (bleach) resistant. Don't do it just for fun. They are slip resistant and stay where you put them. However, it took mine almost a week to lay flat on some edges after unpacking and rolling them out. I bought the brown and it is a very pleasing rich brown. I have 2 inside and one on my porch that gets afternoon sun. I am watching it for fading on that side, none yet. The Florida sand and sun can be brutal. I like these too much to leave it outside if I see any fading start. They feel nice under the feet, hence the one moved to the sitting area outside.

The shipping was fast and my transaction was flawless.",5.0,1

"We purchased the 8x10, and two runners in the ivory.  Being that we have two miniature schnauzers, we did not want to put a lot of money into rugs. They are very well made and have a nice pile height. There is a bit of a dust like substance on the backing of the larger one, but I didn't find it to be a problem, as we will not be moving a rug that size very often. The two runners are rubber backed and stay in place well.  They are very plush and soft to walk on.  Really, you can't beat the price and the FREE Shipping. Will probably be purchasing others for the additional rooms we have with hardwood floors!",5.0,1
"I purchased 2 of the 5x7 rugs and I wasn't sure if the color would be right but it is a very good match to my floor and furniture. Feels good to bare feet.

"I ordered this rug to replace a shag rug i had ordered from another store. They no longer carry it, and I found what I thought was the same one (same brand and description, including the material used in the rug) on walmart.com. This is a cheaper version of a shag rug. It does not feel soft to the touch. Instead the fibers are quite coarse and rough. It does look the same as the better rugs (mostly) so I was still planning to keep it, but as I unrolled it I started to see large areas where it was stained/discolored. I will be returning this rug.",1.0,1
I ordered a maroon rug... and was given a BLACK rug when I went to pick it up. I just moved and didnt have time to wait for the CORRECT item to be delivered so I had to make due. The rug itself is VERY comfortable. To everyone worried how this will compare to the cheap IKEA $59 dollar rugs... this is seriously at least 10times better than those rugs. Very SHAGGY feel and very happy with our new black rug -__-,3.0,1
"Perhaps I got a $75 lemon... but anytime I moved this area rug to clean (1-2 times per week) there was so much of the material from the bottom side of the rug on the floor, it was like a sandy beach. I don't know what it was... glue? plastic? In any event, after just seven months, I threw it out. Tired of having to constantly clean the grainy, sandy whatever it was off of the floor.",1.0,1
"This rug is really soft under foot.  Price was great and shipping was fast.  Finally laid flat in about 5 days.  I ordered the soft gold, but in my light looks like a medium to dark beige.  Very nice though.  If you are on the fence - go for it  You'll be satisfied.",5.0,1
"I received this area rug quickly, BUT the way it was packaged was done POORLY, the plastic cover is very thin and it arrived with 3 holes in it and the carpet fibers black, needless to say, I did not open it, I took the packing slip off of it and returned it PROMPTLY to the store. If this rug was packaged correctly, it would be better, I can not share with you the quality of the rug because I did not open it.",1.0,1
"I had been looking for a shag rug for a while, I've bought a couple other area rugs but they have that indoor/outdoor carpet feel and look flat so I wanted something nicer. I wanted the shag rug style but they are so expensive.. I seen this rug and bought it in the 5x8 size, rich brown color and it has been great. The quality is great, I have laminate wood floor and it stays place pretty well, occasionally I have to readjust it but not too often. It is also one of the most affordable rugs in this style that I have found. I do vacuum mine frequently, this not only keeps it clean but it makes the shag look great too. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a shag style rug at an affordable price.",5.0,1
"i ordered the rich brown in the 5x8 size, i was looking for a shaggy rug that fit my budget this one was perfect. looks beautiful, my kids and pomeranian love it. i was skeptical on the color since my pom is white but its perfect . It has not gone flat its still shaggy even after i vaccum it. i had it for 1month so far so good",5.0,1
"This is a nice carpet for the price. We wanted something not so pricey but something that would look good. My kids love the feel of the carpet on their bare feet. I just wish it would have come in a charcoal grey color instead of brown, but it still looks good in our living room.",5.0,1
"I like this grey shag rug. It suits my purpose of an accent rug with the added benefit of covering up
a stain that I have given up on. Is this rug top of the line? No, but it is not a cheap rug that
will fall apart in a few months. Believe me, I've had a few of those.

This is my second purchase of this brand. I actually have the exact rug, but in a larger
size and color. It has lasted nicely over four years. Easy to care for, great colors and
while it is not the thickest rug I have, it measures up to a mid weight rug that hasn't
stretched or lost any of its luster. I would buy this rug again and probably will be buying
a few more of these rugs in the future.

An added bonus for me, they stay in place nicely on my carpet and on my linoleum floor. No need for carpet tape, well, unless you like to vacuum throw rugs, and fight with the vacuum once it starts eating them. A good shake is so much easier though.",4.0,-1
"It's soft and plush - feels good on bare feet. One end never would lay flat, it was ""wavy"" but we put that end under the bed and it looks fine. This wasn't a problem for us but it would've been if you were using it on an open floor space or under a coffee table or something. Aside from that, it's a good value.",4.0,-1
I'm sorry to say it but this is the 3rd rug I bought. I love the feel and look of it but the carpet seems to just crease up and become a tripping hazard. When it gets walked on it bunchs up into the entertainment center or couch and that's how the creases start. I wish it didn't do that. I even tried having the furniture hold it down and it made matters worse!   :(,1.0,-1

"I was doing my normal Walmart shopping when I happened to pass by the rug aisle. The 5' x 8' version of this rug caught my eye. It was gorgeous!! And just what I was looking for!! I am having new laminate flooring installed in my house, and was looking for a cream colored area rug for the living room. Well, I rushed home, got my credit card, and rushed back to Walmart to buy this rug, and two matching throw rugs to go with it. I vacuumed the rug, then used my Hoover steam vac to shampoo it (to get rid of the 'new rug' smell and any manufacturing dust). I then hung the rug over a tall ladder in the sun to dry. The rug is absolutely beautiful, and feels very thick and luxurious when you walk on it! I can tell it is very high-quality. If I could give it ten stars, I would!!! I recommend buying a rug pad to make the rug last a long time and prevent slippage on hard floors.",5.0,1
I was looking for an inexpensive area rug because my hardwood floor in my bedroom gets so cold in the winter. I ordered online and was a bit skeptical when the rug arrived because in the packaging it looked like a short loop more like a berber. When I opened the carpet and got it laid out onto my floor it fluffed up nicely and was exactly what I was looking for. I love the rich dark grey color and the shag feels nice under my bare feet. I liked that rug seems well constructed and lays nice on the floor with no problem of turned up corners and edges.,5.0,1
"I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the rugs I received, especially given the price! Strands of the rug are already falling out and one of the rugs won't even lay flat... it is wavy and rippled. The only reason I didn't return them is that I was moving my son into his college dorm and didn't have time to make the return and find something better. STAY AWAY FROM THESE RUGS!!!",1.0,1
"This rug arrived really dirty in one corner. I'm a stay at home mom and I don't have the ability to just cram a huge rush into my car with two kids and drag it back to Walmart. I think I can get the dirt out with a little elbow grease but I was so eager to use my rug, I just hid the ugly under my couch. I think they need to improve the packaging on this product, instead of just putting it in some thin plastic wrap. I'm giving this 3 stars because I think it is unacceptable for a brand new item to arrive dirty. Other than that I really love this rug. Feels so nice. My baby loves it too and I think it's helping him explore textures. I'm actually ordering another so that I can line it up next to the one I have. Makeshift frieze carpet! Still: three stars for the DIRT!",3.0,1
"I have purchased these before. I use them in my bathroom as accent rugs to cover the large tiled area and to prevent slipping. The quality is good and that is really all I need for the purpose.
They do not wear for a very long time but suit the visual image that I want.",4.0,1
I received this rug and it had a couple huge stains on it.. It looked like someone had rubbed graphite on it. I tried to remove stain with stain remover because I did not feel like going through the hassle of hauling that huge rug back to the store -but they still did come out all the way.,1.0,1
"I love this rug! It is soft , comfortable and cleans easily. Well worth the price!! You don't need a rug liner because it has its own nonskid backing. Fluffs up nicely when vacuumed. The color is great!! It does not show a lot of dirt or pet hair which is great for me since we have three large hairy dogs! LOVE THIS RUG!",5.0,1

"Rug arrived ahead of expected date. It arrived in perfect condition with the rubber backing to prevent slipping, as was stated in the ad.

Very satisfied with this purchase!",5.0,1

"I purchased 2 of the 8x10 rugs for my living room. After having the gold/cream for a few years (and loving it), I was nervous about going with a darker color. These showed up in a rich dark brown and really looks nice with my green/gold living room colors. I also bought a dark brown runner for my upstairs and 2 gray runners and 1 gray 5x7 rug for my bedroom. The gray rugs seem to be slightly softer but I'm very pleased (just like I was with the gold/cream rug years ago) with these purchases. Most of the new carpet smell is out of it but there was a strong smell when first opened. They hold up against the vacuum very well. They are very soft and great for bare feet. Both the gold/cream and dark brown don't show dirt or anything on the floor which is really nice. For the price, I would buy again in a heartbeat!",5.0,1
My son was so excited upon receiving this. Great size for a 4 year old and it's nice and light while remaining soft. Folds up nicely and doesn't take up too much space.,5.0,-1
"I ordered this shag rug in Rivera Blue. The color is much darker than shown. The description says it has a non-slip backing, but it doesn't. I would have to purchase a rubber mat to put underneath it to protect my hardwood floor.

Needless to say, I returned it the same day it was delivered. Very disappointing.",1.0,1
"I ordered the ivory rug in February. So far I'd say my money hasn't been wasted. I'm not in love with the rug, but it does look nice. As others have said, it does smell funny. The smell dies down, but if you lay on it you can still smell mine (5 months later). Every time I vacuum it I feel like it's going to start ripping the shags out, but I've never owned a shag rug before so that could be normal. I also think it seems to be getting dirty very easily, though I live alone and never have people over. I did have to clean dirt off of it after it was delivered. That was annoying, but it came out easily. Scrubbing at it to get stains out seems to be very hard on the rug, and I've only scrubbed lightly. It does leave little crusty pieces everywhere from the underneath material. I would recommend this to others, especially if they're going with a color other than ivory. As a final note, I don't think it feels that soft. The material looks good, but feels cheap. When I sit on it, it hurts my skin, so I usually put a blanket under me. It feels ok to walk on.",4.0,1
"Ok, the rug was lower priced online than in the store, a plus. It arrived earlier than expected, another plus! However, when I unrolled it, I noticed a 2"" grey stain! Ugh! The color is fresh ivory! C'mon. Overall, I like it and hid the stain under furniture. Would I do it again? Yah, sure.",1.0,1
"Purchased these shag rugs online; one in the 5'x8' and two 3'4""x5'. We ordered all three rugs in rich plum, which is more of a burgundy. Its a rich, dark color which is exactly what we wanted. The shag pile is very soft to walk on, not coarse like some shags can be. Our order arrived within three days from the date of purchase (actually a day earlier than estimated). Because of the binding from shipping, when we unrolled the large 5x7, the pile in some areas was very flat. I took a broom and swept in across the flatten areas and viola, plush pile. I always steam clean our rugs when first purchased and these cleaned very easily. I noticed no odor, snags, discolorations, etc. that can sometimes plague a new rug purchased online. For the price, these were a steal. Couldn't be happier with this purchase.",5.0,1
The color of the rug was exactly how the website showed it to be. it came in a clear plastic bag which was fine but it was folded and the ridge it left from the fold I have not been able to get out yet.I'm sure in time it will come out but for the price the quality is fine. It would be great if they were had rolled it and then put it in the plastic bag then there would not be any fold marks.,4.0,-1
"I ordered online 2 of these rugs in the color taupe. When they were delivered I washed them right away because of the creases from the folds in shipment. After washing, the rugs came out super fluffy. Which was nice but the texture was completely different from the un washed version. My socks are also sticking to them when I walk acros them.
I have a cream colored rug just like these that I bought at the store and it never does that when I wash it.
One of the two taupe rugs was also cut shorter and it them different sizes.
I like these rugs but if ordered online, make sure you inspect them before washing.",3.0,-1
"This 8x10 rug, definitely met my expectations. I purchased it because I have tile flooring in my great room, where my daughter usually plays with her toys.

Good quality and it feels great.",5.0,-1

"I bought the 8x10 Ivory rug and it's gorgeous -- looks very high-end. The color can be accurately described as ""oatmeal"". It was wrapped securely in plastic and arrived in perfect condition.

The only reason I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars is the strong chemical smell my new rug is giving off. I've had the rug for 2 hours and have had a terrible headache since unrolling it. Hopefully the smell will wear off in a few days.",4.0,-1
"Not bad for the price, but do not expect this item to look like the picture. It's neither as vivid or clear as the image makes it out to be. For 19.00, probably the best deal you will find, you pay for what you get. don't expect it to look exactly like the picture.",2.0,-1
"This rug is awesome. The high rating is appropriate. I rolled it out and fluffed it and it looked awesome! its been about 6 months now and its still fluffy (with vacuuming or hand fluffing). My 3 year old loves laying on it. My 7 month old is safe on it, but I also puchased a rug mat (which makes all the difference).  He loves rubbing his feet and legs on it and so do we. We have all tiles in the home so we got the large area rug and its our favorite room. Plus it stopped our furniture from moving everytime someone shifted. There is some shedding but nothing to worry about. Believe the positive reviews!!",5.0,-1
"When this rug arrived, it was wrapped in plastic, however the plastic was completely wet and had soaked through. It was the second rug I ordered.

I have hardwood floors and my baby refuses to crawl on his knees so he does the army crawl everywhere. We decided to buy this rug and its been going great!

"I wish it were a little more thicker padded underneath and the rug itself was softer. However, for the price it was a great deal still and looks really nice. Just unroll and give it a little fluff and it is good to go. We will buy padding for underneath to suit our needs seeing we bought rug primary for baby and toddler to play on.",3.0,-1
"Purchased the ivory color online- it's a basic light cream color that would go with almost any room and is true to size (I ordered 8x10). For the price this is an awesome rug and does the job, we put it in a kids play room over linoleum so didn't want to pay a ton in case of stains and wear and tear. I docked it 1 star because the shag isn't as plush as it could be (you can feel the hard plastic in between the shag spools) and also because as most other reviews said- the packaging it came in sucked. Our rug had a huge mud looking stain on the corner, but I got it out for the most part with soap and water. Too big to return easily so we'll let it be, but at least I know for future stains that they'll most likely come out okay. After a lot of searching for an inexpensive large area rug this is by far the best price we found and are rather pleased.",4.0,-1
"I really can't speak to the rug quality since we never left the store with it. After reading a couple of the earlier reviews, we had the rug shipped to the store rather than our home so we could check it out. It arrived with the packaging torn in a couple of different places and the rug was dirty in at least one of those spots. We were not willing to accept the rug in that condition. We were extremely disappointed as it appeared to be just what we were looking for in a rug(other than the dirty stain). Would suggest Walmart reevaluate the wrapping that they ship the rugs in.",1.0,-1
"We bought a 8' x 10' rug in Fresh Ivory online for our living room to tie together blue upholstered and dark wood furniture, and ivory/off-white accents to allude to a nautical theme. The rug became flat in a day and lost its unpleasant chemical odor in the next couple of days. It's shag but not too shag, a marble (from Marble run kids game, etc.) can't be completely buried in the loops but certainly might be overlooked (ouch) and loops are not particularly dense but certainly are not sparse either which makes it particularly good for a not too-feminine but cozy look. Kids and cats loved it immediately despite the smell and our living room is certainly livable now.

Now drawbacks: I mentioned the smell but it will be gone soon. Second, the rug's backing does shed some white dust-like particles but I presume these are a leftover of manufacturing process and will eventually be vacuumed off as the backing itself doesn't seem to be falling apart.

The color is more of cream than ivory IMO and I almost wanted to return it. In the room full of off-white and ivory, off-white trim on walls and the walls of this peachy-cream neutral builders paint, the rug is closest to the walls color which I would never describe as an off-white. I was able to switch accessories a little bit to achieve the right look but if you are wondering what exact shade it is be prepared that it might be not the ivory you have in mind. The plus side is that because of a darker shade of ivory/cream, it will not lose its freshness longer.

And the last, during shipping, the package, though well made, teared on one side and there is a dirty spot which I think will be easy to remove but inspect your delivery carefully before deciding to unroll it as I did.

Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and would buy this rug again if I need it.",5.0,-1
"Been researching and looking for an area rug 5×7 or larger that was shag/thick without costing me a fortune. Looked at over 8 stores and all were a minimum of $80-100!!!
I was very skeptical about this rug. Being such a low price I wasn't expecting much. What a wonderful surprise! Rolled out in front of my couch and it's perfect. Plush and soft! Both my dogs and my toddler where laying all over it! It mskes our toom feel so warm and cozy now!! Will definitely be buying more for other rooms!!",5.0,-1

And they clean up very well, too. My cat threw up on one of them twice and the rug cleaned like a charm. Very happy. Would recommend, except maybe not for high traffic areas.",5.0,-1
With a baby and dog I go through rugs like crazy. I was looking for something cheap but with out looking cheap. This rug is great. It is exactly the color I was looking for.

Overall I'm very happy with the rug. I've had it for a month and it looks brand new. Easy to clean and vacuum.,4.0,-1
"it arrived in a timely manner. The rug wasn't that shaggy, it was much more harder than most shag rugs, but I love it nonetheless. Some parts of the rug do come off at times. A few pieces here or there, but nothing that changes the look of the rug. I personally like it.",4.0,-1
"This rug was not at all what I expected. I ordered the 8 x 10, in taupe. When it came, the label said 'Coconut'. It did however match the color in the pic online. It was extremely long shag (not like the 5 x 7 Mohawk 'shag' rug that I already have). Nearly impossible to run the vacuum on. And every time you walked across it, you could see your foot prints.. the long shag was very dark in color when pressed down in the opposite direction (if that makes sense..?). Anyhow, I rolled it back up and took it to my local walmart.. this rug was just not what I was looking for. On the plus side, the rug was shipped to my house in no time and the return was very quick and easy.",2.0,-1
"Bought this for my daughters 13th birthday. We were making over her room transforming it into a teeneager room. This rug added to the room nicely. Nice, sturdy, soft and a bold black color. Only complaint is that because its new some of the threads on the outside of the rug are shedding, (i guess thats what u would call it) but I'm sure after a few times vaccuming it that will stop. It is by no means a lot just a couple so its not noticeable, but annoying to constanty have to pick up those shaggy pieces.",5.0,-1

"perfect just what i was looking for. if you want a kaki color then be sure to order the soft gold. It is not god at all . It is a kaki color.

I got the opportunity to redecorate my living room lately which includes purchasing a new rug. I ordered this one online during Black Friday sales due to price and color. When I received it I was in complete shock. It was more beautiful in person than online. Very soft. Bigger than I expected so I got even more for my money. I would recommend this product to anyone.,5.0,1
"This rug was pretty much as described. I got the 5x8 gold color and it looked as expected. It was shedding at first and is hard to vacuum, but I think that goes for all shag rugs. It's still worth it because the shag is really comfortable. It makes my bedroom (with wood floors) more inviting. warm, and less creaky. As always with Walmart.com, the shipping was fast and it was wrapped well.",5.0,-1
"My husband and I love this rug. I got the chocolate brown for our rustic living room. It doesn't show dirt or mud from the pups.
It does lose partials of the rug shag when vacuumed but I think that's pretty normal.
That was the only reason I didn't rate 5. For the money it's great quality and looks good.",4.0,-1
I bought some of these Mohawk shag rugs from another store and they didn't offer this size in the runner. As it turns out -- these rugs are the exact same as the one's sold by Home Depot but with some additional sizes and cheaper prizes. They match the HD rugs perfectly so I am very happy about that. This particular runner was just a bit smaller than I expected but it will work.,4.0,-1
This was a purchase I researched extensively. I needed a 8x10 rug to go under a bed that sits on hardwood floors. I wanted something in a neutral color with some Cush to it. This rug did not disappoint. It's A beautiful whitish light color. Once lasted out and vacuumed it looks and feels like wall to wall carpeting. Came earlier then expected and in great shape when it arrived. The price was the best however. Similar rugs cost upward of 35O-400 dollars. With tax this was less then 150 dollars. I love Walmart!!,5.0,-1
"I have spent a lot of time searching for the perfect rug throughout Kansas City and disappointed in what I was finding. Either the price was too much, or poor quality at a reasonable price.

Now I have found both. I bought a 8 x 10 area rug and a pad and couldn't believe the savings. I received the rug first, and honesty really didn't need the pad. The carpet is a nice thick shag and looks better than many of rugs at twice the cost. Thanks Walmart for making my day, and not robbing my pocketbook!",5.0,-1
"I received the 8 x 10 rug in a beige/gold color. When I picked it up from the store I was a little scared because it looked super gold but when I got it home, put it in the room, and vacuumed the rug it looked more beige which is what I wanted. Not a high quality rug but for the price it is decent.",4.0,-1
"If I could cover all my flooring with this rug I would! I absolutely love it! The look, the feel and the quality is great. The first week or so I was vacuuming a few times a day as the rug sheds but after the first five or six days it stopped. My family loves it, my kids are playing on the floor a lot more as well.",5.0,-1
"My only complaint is it is darker than advertised; it's gold colored. Other than that, very plush & stays put on my tile floor. Had a weird chemical smell and was flat in spots when I got it but I just vacuumed it out and that fluffed it up and got rid of the smell. I like it.",4.0,-1
"I have bought 2 of these rugs and I am very pleased with one of them. I purchased a gray one and a beige one and the gray seems to be much better quality. The beige one seems to have more of a shabby frayed look to it, doesn't look that great to me I will be returning it...but the gray one is fantastic looks well made and is comfortable. It does slide a bit so a rug pad underneath might be a good investment. I would still recommend this product because you really can't beat the price (especially on a 5x8 rug) but just beware when buying online, 2 of the same products just different color seem to come in looking rather different from each other.",4.0,-1
"I had already had this rug in the red color, I loved it, but we painted the room it was in and the red just would not go there, so I ordered the sand colored one.... I love it. I was raised in a home with shag carpet and love the look and feel... My daughter begged for my red rug.... so that makes 2 satisfied customers.",5.0,-1
"I bought the gold shag in August 2011. It was exactly what I wanted. I bought the 8 x 10 and it fit perfectly. Yes, there was some grit or sandy bits on the back of the rug but I was able to vacuum up with no problem. It stood up to tons of traffic over the past 4 years. I even rotated the rug at the 2 year mark since part of the rug goes underneath my sofa. Note, the gold is very light but a nice shade.

Recently, I really wanted a dark chocolate/brown shag rug. I looked up the rug on the Walmart website and sure enough, there it was, for a little cheaper too. I love this rug too. Perfect color, holds up well.

For the price = excellent product. I will buy another one.....in about 4 years.... :)",5.0,-1
"Dislike the wood floors in the home we bought. Wanted something for the bedroom floor, yet didn't want wall to wall carpeting. This rug is adorable, soft,fits the space where I needed it. The shag doesn't flatten down and the color is a wonderful match for the drapes. Love it.",5.0,-1
"I bought this in the cream color to brighten up my living room for the holidays. Given the price I expected to need to do something nicer in the spring. However, this is a very nice rug at a great price. There will be no need for another. It is soft, and plush. It looks much more expensive than it was. I put a pet friendly, soft rug pad under it and it feels like you are walking on a cloud. Even with a dog and a cat, it shows very little shedded fur and vacuums up beautifully. I highly recommend it.",5.0,-1
"We have a rescue dog that had some trouble adjusting to being home alone. This created a need for some repairs, new furniture and carpets. It made no sense to spend a lot of money because he is a bit unpredictable. So I bought this carpet. The price said ""cheap"" but it is a really nice rug. There is no unusual odor and the color is exactly the color that was displayed on my tablet. It vacumns nicely also. I am very pleasantly surprised!",1.0,-1
"I found this Riviera blue rug's color to be a dull blue, just a shade or two lighter than Navy blue. I was hoping for a more teal blue.
The rug is tufted rather sparsely. If you can afford it, I'd suggest getting a plusher, softer shag rug at a home improvement store for a few more bucks.",2.0,-1
"This is a nice, soft, plush rug. We have two in the chocolate brown color and love them! One for my daughter's nursery and one for the living room where she usually plays. I don't worry about spills because of the dark color. And I don't worry about her crawling around on it because it is nice and soft. I am not sure how long it will hold up, they sometimes have fibers come loose when I vaccum. For the price, this is a great purchase!",4.0,-1
This rug far exceeded my expectations. Buying online is a bit frightening because you can't determine the quality and comfort. I must say that this rug is so pretty and I've recieved so many compliments from visitors. In addition to it being so pretty is the wonderful feeling of walking on it in bare fert. It looks and feels luxurious!,5.0,-1
Good find. I had originally ordered a similar one from Target with the Threshold brand. I not even sure how the rug would have been because it was delivered to my porch with both ends showing for a couple of inches and various holes that wore dirty in the rug. This rug was double coated in protection and it is great. I got the ivory and it is cream. Lightens up the entire room.,5.0,-1
"I have to say, I am completely surprised by this rug. I purchased this rug in the 5x7 size and because it was inexpensive, I thought the rug would be too....no such thing. Holds up pretty nice. After 2 dogs play on it, even after several times of vacuuming, it fluffs up pretty nicely. I would recommend this to anyone who would like a shag rug!",5.0,-1
"Took a chance to sort of match another taupe Mohawk cheapie area rug without seeing it first. Color was significantly different than as it appeared on 2 different computer screens. Didn't seem to match any of the colors presented. Yes, it's very inexpensive, but it is not as ""real"" as my other Mohawk rugs from another big box store. Almost looks like it should be in a bathroom.",2.0,-1

"Nice rug, excellent value. I bought several for our master bedroom, in several sizes, to warm up our cold winter floors. Beside looking great and feeling good on the feet, I think the rugs, with a pad, are keeping our old house warmer this winter. 

About color and texture? The rich brown, a warm but nearly neutral tone, in classic shag, is a perfect complement to the dark mahogany furniture in our traditional bedroom. 

And, FYI, when the rugs arrived, we first placed it in our ‘50s living room. just to see if they might work in there. The room’s walls and ceiling are paneled in dark pine and the floor are also dark pine. The room’s furnishings are white, black, dark brown, clear glass, and in cool, modern tones, the styling modern/post-modern, 

The shag’s pile, length, texture and sheen was certainly perfect in the living room but we so obviously needed a much lighter rug in such a dark space. Wish there was currently an option to buy the rug in beige in the size we need, but it is currently out of stock. Darn!",5.0,-1
"I'm using this as a carpet over carpet. So my original carpet doesn't get dirty from my Guinea pigs who like to run around on the floor. Packaged well, delivered quickly, set up was easy. Smells good. Feels great. I've had it only for 5 days but there hasn't been any shedding of the materials. If I had to complain about something it would be that some parts of the edges of the carpet aren't fully flat on the ground. I'm assuming this is because it's new, and with time it will eventually flatten out.",5.0,-1
"After rolling the rug out, I noticed a large amount of grity, sandy material coming off the back. I attempted to vacuum as much as I could. However, it just continued to come off. I wish I had listened to the other reviewers who had mentioned this issue. The rug itself is cozy, just very irritating that it sheds a sandy coat on your floor.",3.0,-1
"We ordered the 8x10 area rug a few weeks ago and are pleasantly surprised considering the low price. This is a very nice rug. Soft to walk on and it provides an excellent space for grandson to play.

"I bought this for the under our dining table and chairs. My husband wanted a dark color because it would blend into our dark hardwood floors so that it didn't make our room look smaller.

"It took me forever to choose an area rug. Needed something to cover old ugly one in rental. I opted for the name rather than cheap and I am so glad. What a difference this made to the overall appearance of my little home. It is shag and I originally thought I didn't want shag. But glad I went with it. It really looks great and it hides most everything. I normally vacuum once per day, but finding I don't have to. I've moved furniture around on it and the indents bounce right back. Another thing for me, there was no obnoxious chemical smell.

It was easy to unroll and flatten right out. I'm very happy with it!",5.0,-1
"I had been searching online for an area rug for my dining room. Unfortunately, most sites wanted $300+ for an 8'x10'. I was resigned to pay that amount, when I found this rug. The reviews were great, and the color was what I wanted. At half the cost of other rugs, I'm very happy with my purchase. The rug is as described, looks great, feels good underfoot, and vacuums nicely. The only slight con I have is it's not as thick/plushy as I would've liked. However, a pad underneath the rug does the trick. Overall, I would definitely recommend this rug.",4.0,-1

I wanted something a shade of light to medium Brown, so I bought it in Taupe and just love the color. It looks great on my wood floor. I feels very soft on the feet but could use a little bit thicker padding. Because it's in a spare bedroom it will not have high traffic so it will last for many years.",4.0,-1

So far so good, I'm a very satisfied customer and will definitely recommend this rug to friends and family. :)",5.0,-1
"I originally purchased this rug because it was within my price point and May he'd my living room perfectly. I didn't have the highest of hopes because it was so cheap and I had seen a few in the store that didn't look so great in person. I absolutely LOVE this rug. It's soft and looks so much more expensive that it actually was. I think the company must have seen the negative reviews before because the rug has no smell, came well wrapped and clean and there is flaking from the backing at all. Not even a tiny bit. I'm glad I didn't listen to the reviews because I'd miss out. Totally would buy it again. I also bought it in Rich Plum, which is a really nice deep red.",5.0,-1

"Considering it is low priced, it is excellent for the price! Easily cleaned.. take to car wash and spray it clean .. take over to vacuum and suck moisture out.. it is light weight and loose weave so it is easy to suck moisture out and hang over something to  let it dry completely.. if you have a wet dry vac you can pour water and mild soap like dawn dishwashing liquid over dirty spots and scrub with hands or brush or broom and suck the water and dirt right off of it.. it does not hold stains due to the fiber it is made from.

Good quality for the price.  Perfect rug for my guest room.  I bought the 8 x 10 and note that it is NOT latexed back.  I ordered a non skid pad for hardwood floors to use under it.

Took a chance on the King's gold color since it was cheaper and the other reviewer was right that it is more on the tan side of gold.  Quite happy all in all.,5.0,-1
"Nice plush carpet. Everyone in house enjoying it, even the dogs! Has slight odor when first opened but nothing major. Vacuum it every other day, kids and dogs play on it and seems durable.

I expected more because of the previous reviews. The rug is very thin and when I unrolled it the backing went flying all over. It was little flake like plastic stuff. It also had a strong chemical odor. That being said once it settled and was vacuumed it. Fluffed up and it's not terrible. I bough it as a rug for my daughter to play on and I'm still not sure if I will cause of the smell. But this would be great for an extra room. It lookes nice.,3.0,-1

"I am in Heaven! This is truly love at first sip. If I didn’t have this already, this would be first on my list for every occasion, you just ca not go wrong with this machine. Once you have this coffee machine, you just will never be able to go back to anything else ever again. Coffee in the morning has never been easier. It is one touch, smooth operation and pure bliss. The coffee is amazing! When I say amazing, I mean better than the best barista coffee house there is, custom made, purely, indulgently amazing. The Aeroccino is a game changer. It is the best thing, well, since the Keurig cups, but 100% better. I can make the best matcha tea, within a minute, from pouring the milk into the aeroccino and stirring in the matcha. This machine is fast, efficient and perfect. This aeroccino has its own set of technology that I do not understand but in just a few seconds my milk is frothy and hot. Do no overdo the milk in the frother, it doubles in size and if you are not careful, it will over flow. Also, this machine needs TLC when cleaning the aeroccino because you cannot get the bottom mechanism wet. It is a simple rinse and sponge clan then I set it upside down to dry. I am truly in love with my Nespresso and Aeroccino, I can never have regular coffee again.",5.0,-1
"“Time for a coffee?” This seems to be the new thing in our house. The Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker Bundle with Aeroccino Milk Frother by De'Longhi has now become our favorite coffee machine. I’m sorry to say, after a few years with the “K” brand, the Nespresso took us by surprise and won our hearts. For some unknown reason, I felt that the Nespresso brewed better coffee than the “K” brand. If you look back in the old days when we used to make coffee, we ground the coffee beans and “cook” it in our coffee pot. The grounded beans in the coffee pot percolate as it brews the coffee to a fine taste. Delonghi’s Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee maker reminds me of those days – the process of grounded coffee was transformed into something pure and magical. The taste of the coffee you get from Delonghi’s Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee maker is definitely extraordinary. The coffee is full bodied and the aroma – the smell of the coffee as you sip is absolutely fantastic. There are so many times that you would always go for a second cup of coffee. Delonghi’s Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee Maker has always been the topic when friends and family come over. This is a machine that you can be proud of.",5.0,-1
"This is a beautiful highly functional, yet simple to operate, machine. After setting up, I cleaned the unit for first time use, per the instructions. Selected & inserted one of the included Nespresso pods (includes a set of 12) started it up and watched it make the prettiest cup of coffee I've ever seen made at home. The pods have a bar code that reads it's intended time and water amount, to brew the perfect topped off cup, before adding the optional froth made by the included frothing machine. I have multiple machines, but THIS ONE is the one I want and have displayed on my counter top for daily use. It has easy to understand lights and pictures to indicate when it's ready and or minimum and maximum liquid limits, on machine as well as the frother. It's a bit loud during it's cleaning & pod spinning operations, but it's brief and alright with me. OH... There is even a function called, ""descaling"" which lets you know it's time to clean your system from excess buildup, between uses. Read up on the instruction manual, it'll tell ya all about it. LOVE IT!",5.0,-1
"I have to say that i am really impressed with this DeLonghi Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee & Espresso Single-Serve Machine. Aside from the fact that the coffee itself taste awesome, the milk frother does wonders. I tried this with my Silk almond milk and was amazed by how much it foamed. Now, another plus for me was that it came with 3 packs of coffee capsules. With 12 capsules in a pack i got a total of 36 capsules. I think it only suppose to come with 12 though.ni have had it for a week now and my husband and ai tried it everyday. We really do love the taste of the coffee, it is really rich with a strong taste. We saw some reviews about leakage and we are pleased to say that we have none, but we doe try to put exactly 30 ounces and not a drop more, because the container can hold about 32 to 34 ounces but only 30 is recommended. I woukd definitely recommend this product to coffee lovers....... just let it full you thermos or mug and you are good to go.",5.0,-1

"This coffee system (the machine and pods) makes great coffees, espressos, lattes and cappuccinos that taste just like the big store coffee places. The major difference is that those franchise coffee restaurants charge so much money per cup and I end up saving quite a bit of money by making these coffee drinks at home myself. Yes, there is an initial investment of the pods, which depending on where you buy them and the pod count, could run you easily a minimum of $50. On the Nespresso website a single pod averages $1, and an assortment pack are about the same and more. There is lots of room for you to control the costs and I enjoy the ability to buy specific flavors and at my choice of quantities on the Nespresso website, versus buying an assortment and not using half of them because I don’t like the flavor as much (waste of money).

"I was skeptical about purchasing a mirror online, but I also didn't feel like lugging one from the store. besides, I feel like I couldn't find exactly what I was looking for in store. 
I wanted something sleek and modern that would fit the design flow in my home. this mirror and its sleek frame are elegant and mesmerizing. A mirror, depending on its location, should simply open up the room and bring in more light, reflect the room and make it seem larger. well, this mirror did not disappoint.  
from the moment it arrived on my doorstep, I realized how secure and padded it was. Styrofoam and multiple layers of cardboard along with hard cardboard corners and sides. once I hung it, it blended so well into the space. 
overall, it is an impressive piece.",5.0,-1

"The Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso maker is an easy to use machine to make your own espresso at home. The instructions are easy to follow, and one of the features that stood out to me was the used capsule container. Once a capsule is used, the machine lifts it up and disposes of it into a container that is in the back of the machine. Even though this seems like a relatively simple feature, I find it to be pretty useful when you are brewing multiple cups of espresso. The milk frother works great, and adds the prefect touch to my cup of espresso. All in all, I am in love with how easy and quick this machine makes a cup a delicious cup of espresso. I highly recommend this product.",5.0,-1

"I absolutely love this coffee maker. The unboxing and assembly was straightforward. It even comes 3 boxes of sample capsules!!! First the coffee machine. Once it is set up, the instructions are pretty easy to follow as long as you can make up your mind on which capsule to start with :). The fun also does not stop there, please be sure to use a transparent cup so you can actual see your picture ready coffee being made. Due to the high pressure system, the coffee actually comes out with a layer of coffer foam on top, which is pretty amazing just to look at. In my opinion, the coffee also tasted better than the coffee made by the traditional drip coffee maker. Then there is the milk frother. I have used a generic milk frother before but I can definitely say now that you can what you pay for. This frother is much better and does not burn milk with continuous use. It comes with hot and cold settings and also have two froth settings. I used the highest froth setting and the foam was very consistent and can withstand the pouring process to the coffee itself. With three more pumps of caramel, I had a custom made caramel machiato which was so much better than the one by the major chain store. And I didn't even have to get out of the door for this.",4.0,-1

"Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker Bundle with Aeroccino Milk Frother by De'Longhi, Red selected through the Wal Mart Spark Reviewer Program in exchange for my honest opinion. Setting up this item without reading the instructions can cause somethings not to work properly. For some reason, the light on my machine kept flashing orange. I was unable to open the compartment where you place the little capsules by pushing down like instructed. After finally reading the instructions, and multiple other pages, I was able to turn the machine off. Once off, I turned the machine back on and the light finally turned green. After the green light was on, I was able to open the compartment where the capsules go. This thing leaks water like crazy. I do not believe mine leaks as bad as the other reviews I have read but it does leak some water so that's something one should not be surprised if they research prior to purchase. In addition, there is a capsule tray that the capsule slides into once you lift the compartment where the capsules go. I think this is cool. The tray you sit your coffee cup on is adjustable which is a plus.",3.0,-1

"The Nespresso Vertuo Deluxe bundle is amazing. This is hands down the best coffee system we’ve ever tried. The setup and first time clean up is straightforward and easy. It used a lot more water than I thought for the first clean. I used a standard sized mug to collect the expelled liquid and it easily filled up 2-3 of those mugs, so make sure you have a large enough container to collect all the hot water that cycles out. The lever to open/close the pod compartment is sleek and easy to use. All you have to do is tap it up or down and it will automatically open or close itself. I also like that the water container is positioned to the side and it’s large so cleaning it is easy. This machine makes the most amazing coffee too. Each cup results in a frothy drink which I’ve never experienced with other coffee/espresso machines we own. The milk frother is also impressive. It comes with it’s own plate element (like an electric kettle) and it functions for both hot and cold drinks. I’ve mainly been using it for hot drinks and it heats and froths the milk perfectly and gives your hot drink a professional finish. The only thing I don’t like about the frother is that it’s really hard to wash especially when you’re trying to avoid getting the electrical elements wet. It would have been better if the inside part that holds the milk was a removable piece so it could be easily washed. That way you also don’t have to worry about getting water near any electrical components. Aside from that we love everything about this bundle—definitely our new favorite coffee/espresso maker!

Even the power cable is adjustable so you can choose which side of the machine it comes out on. I’m usually not a fan of red, but it really makes a nice pop of color in the kitchen, where all of our other appliances are silver or black. It’s a nice deep red too. ",5.0,-1

"This has been a great addition to my mornings. It is so easy to use and makes a hot, delicious coffee or espresso in very little time. I love that I no longer need to mess with programming a pot the night before or measuring anything out. The machine arrived with a sample box of different flavors and sizes of coffee and espresso and I am enjoying finding my favorites. It detects what size to make, there’s no need to program it - you literally just push the button and it does the rest. There’s even a recycling program when you order the pods directly, and they give you the first free return shipping pouch to get you started. The machine stores the empty pods in the back, it flings the previous pod into the reservoir when you open it to put a new one in. The Aeroccino is a great addition and gives you the ability to easily make a lovely latte or other fancy beverages. A couple of handy features are the adjustable platform which you can raise or lower depending on the size of mug you are using, and you can also configure the water reservoir to fit your space: it can be placed on the left side, right side, or directly behind the machine. It is a sleek and stylish looking machine and high quality. Most importantly the beverages it makes are tasty! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5.0,-1

"This is one nicely built machine. I was impressed by the sleek look of the Nespresso and was excited to give it a try. Setup was very quick and easy. Take it out of the box and give the water reservoir and milk frother a good cleaning and it is ready to go. I do like the red color that this comes in. We put water in the reservoir and the “pod” in the unit and pressed the start button. Within seconds we had hot coffee coming out the unit and it was nice and frothy and rich. We used cold water in the milk frother and was very impressed with how it whipped it up. Cleanup was a snap. The unit has its own clean setting that was easy to use. We also found that you can evacuate most of the water for storage. The unit does come with a sample pack in the box with 12 different coffee pods. I was impressed with that, but found out quickly that the “pods” for the Nespresso are quite costly and I could not find any cocoa or tea pods, this was quite disappointing. I also found out that you cannot operate the unit without a pod, so no getting just hot water from the unit. Overall this is a nice looking machine but I would like to be able to do cocoa, tea, or just get hot water from it so I could mix up my own.",4.0,-1

"I really like this coffee maker. It's easy to set up and use. I received it in the color red, which looks amazing, I might add. Upon first receiving this coffee maker, you will have to run the clean to cycle to begin using it. This doesn't take very long. This machine is also quiet. The water heats up very quickly for use and the coffee comes out looking like you purchased it from a coffee shop. Mines came with the frother which can be used to blend your milk or cream. It can be used with different cup sizes from a regular coffee cup to a expresso shot. Ok some of the cons, the coffee pods are kinda on the expensive side and can only be purchased from the company. A plus to this is that my machine came with three sample packs of the coffee pods which includes 12 pods with each sample pack. Also, some of the coffee can be a little on the strong side, but I'm not a professional coffee drinker. All in all, I think this would be a great investment if you are used to buying coffee from Starbucks like me, because you could save a little.",4.0,-1

This is such a neat invention I am obsessed with it. I love that it only has a small tank as my keurig has this massive tank but only makes a cup of coffee so I always found that pointless and it just takes up more space. The lever is electric so all you have to do it hit it and it goes down or up that is so neat. The used pods go into the back when you open it to put a new one in. It is like a little garbage back there for the used pods. This thing makes an amazing latte and the milk frother that it came with will give you creamy milk in about 30 seconds. It heats the milk up to will it froths it. This came with included pods the box of pods is like a box of elegant chocolates it looks very lavish. Now the downsides the pods are kind of pricey there is no off brands so you have to buy branded. The included pods you will probably not use all because some are decaf and some expresso. I am not a expresso drink I like a cup of coffee not a shot so almost half the box of the pods are still sitting unused I actually have 3 boxes now of half empty pods because I do not use all the ones in the boxes. The machine itself is amazing I just hope the pods become less pricey in the near future. This hands down took over my keurig I never even use that anymore. I like this so much better I can not recommend it enough.,3.0,-1

"The biggest issue I have is the multiple pieces - I have another machine that I love so I can compare it. The water container is an extended piece which takes up an awkward space however it can be picked up from the stand and filled or cleaned. The Aeroccino milk frother is a detached piece that stands alone with its own need for a power outlet. There are pros and cons of a separate part such as using it without the espresso/coffee machine however if there are limited outlets this will take one and the Nespresso will take another. The tray that holds the cup is flimsy, would be easy to break the little tabs that slide in to hook, it is adjustable for cup sizes. The frother is good but not great. The milk is warm but not well frothed. I have another frother brand which is exceptional - the milk is frothed stiff and fluffy with an excellent temp so the Aeroccino is disappointing. ",4.0,-1
I received the Nespresso coffee and espresso maker and tried it. I received the red one and I like the way they designed the coffee and espresso maker and the capsules. You plug it in after filling the clear cylinder with water. When it has heated up pull up on the black lip under the Nespresso logo. It goes up automatically. This is where you put the capsule of coffee. Push the black lip downward and it automatically closes. You can adjust the platform where your cup sits on. Push the button on top of the machine and it starts brewing. It also comes with a milk frother that you plug in separately. The machine preformed well. They have a good variety of different quality flavors.,5.0,-1
"There are things I love and things I don't about this coffee and Espresso machine. I love the convenience of it. I can have a single cup of fancy coffee in just a moment. The water container is great! You can swivel from side to side to accommodate your coffee space. I put in my filtered water and know I have enough water because there is a minimum water reading. It is very simple to use. Plug it in and run a cleaning cycle, does 3 turns, the a little nudge and it springs open for you to put in your pod. Gentle nudge and it closes, press a button and your coffee starts. The smell of the coffee brewing is my favorite part. it smells amazing! My last love is the milk frother. This is just makes the coffee. It heats the milk spins it. I use with almond milk and it is perfect every time.",3.0,-1
My girlfriend and I set this up within just a few minutes. I like that this is simple to set up and use. It's a nice addition to my coffee bar. It looks great on my counter top and the design is sleek and small which is great because it doesn't take up any space on my countertops! Unit is easy to fill and clean. What I don't like is that I can't seem to find the replacement pods for it easily and I can't see to find a refillable unit for it either.,3.0,-1
"This is a nice bundle for any coffee lover. It's been great. I will admit it was a little confusing at first, but only because it looks kind of intimidating with the milk frother and the espresso maker. Also, I'm not a fan of the water tank being off to the side like that. The base to the water tank does swivel around, so you can keep it behind or beside it. This maker is easy enough to use. You push the button on the front to open it, insert the pod (pods were included) close the lid, and hit the button on top. The pods are different sizes depending on what you are making, so make sure and read the manual and use the appropriate cup/mug size to avoid overflow. Overall, It did work pretty well, though. I have only used the frother 1 time, and it did work well. I dont think i will get much use out of it since i have a smaller handheld frother.",4.0,-1
"I received the Nespresso De'Longhi VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Machine with Aerocinno and I love it. This machine is everything if you’re into coffee and espressos. It comes with an Aeroccino Plus frother which a nice touch. It has a one-button operation with automatic capsule ejection, no mess with this one. The heating process is fast and quick for this machine it takes about 15-20 seconds to warm up. It has a barcode-reading technology for blend-specific brewing, no second guessing. The water tank is extra-large, so you can make several cups of espressos or coffee. The setting on the machine is a one-touch button. The machine came with a starter set of pods and capsules. Also, I received two extra starter kits which are great to try out all the levels of the coffee and espresso. There are different levels to the pods which can make your coffee and espresso to your full liking. Maybe one day you want a stronger cup or weaker no problem for this machine. The cleanup of the machine was a snap, just take a warm wet towel a wipe it down. You can even use a paper towel for clean up if you prefer. You can also put the pieces of the machine in the dishwashers to sanitize it. I would definitely recommend this machine to anyone who loves good coffee and espressos and want a machine at home, it’s well worth the price.",5.0,-1

"Honestly, I got it for free so I can't comment on the value of the purchase. However, I like the way it works. I wish I didn't have to buy single use pods and I hope to one day move away from these pod coffee makers but until I can afford a really nice one I'll stick with this.",4.0,-1

"I've had Nespresso machines for over 5 years and have never been disappointed. The great thing about the Vertuo Plus Deluxe bundle is that it is a streamlined no-frills model. The color of the coffeemaker is very elegant and I appreciate the ease of self-cleaning (three pushes of the coffee making button without a pod). My only (small) wish list item is that the water reservoir lid is not the easiest to open and could be redesigned to improve that. Otherwise, it is a great coffeemaker and I'm glad to have it!

I absolutely love this machine! I wanted one for the longest time and finally got one. I am not even sure what I was drinking previously because it certainly was not coffee the way it was meant to be enjoyed. The machine is small and attractive on my countertop. I particularly like that the water tank can be swiveled to either side or the back. The operation is simple and works well every time. You can brew 5 different sizes based on the selected capsule. With that flexibility and the included Aerochino you can make an endless array of professional coffee and espresso drinks. I LOVE making my morning treat every day now!

I was so impressed with what was in my mug the first time - a rich, frothy coffee that didn't even need milk. The machine itself is super sleek, easy to use. It's not complicated with buttons and screens, just a few easy motions and you're good to go. I love this machine for my kitchen and feel like it's a morning-changing addition!

"We have been having amazing Espressos and Lattes ever since we received our Nespresso a couple of weeks ago. It is so easy to use and clean up.

My husband was worried that he wouldn't be able to make it but he's had no problem and said it's way easier than he thought. So far every coffee, espresso and latte has been perfect.

"This espresso maker offers incredible functionality and a small package and at a great price. The loading mechanism works very well and always provides a satisfying click. It is fast to heat up the water and start producing the coffee. At this point I’ve only tried a few pods, however, the taste is consistent and the quality is consistent each time with every brew. The build design and quality is also very reassuring, giving off the vibe that this device can be used for a very long time. Furthermore, I very much like the milk steam generator and have been using it to make lattes and cappuccinos. Overall this is a very nice device provided in a compact package with great utility. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of espresso and wishes to bring an exciting way to make coffee into their home. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5.0,-1

"First of all the set up of this is extremely easy. It takes less than 10 minutes to set up. The design is very sleek and takes up very little counter top space which is great. The bundle we got also comes with a frothier which plugs in separately, and that is also sleek and works very well.  This machine makes it very easy to make your drink as well, as all you really do is fill the water tank and put the pod in. After there is no clean up as the pods go right into a holding tin so you don;t have to clean them up right away. Any drink we made with this was very good. The best I can describe it is quality over quantity. If you real value the taste of your morning drink then I highly recommend this maker. It is by far the best quality I have experienced. It is also amazing how many different types of coffes/drinks this thing can make. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5.0,-1

"The Vertuo Plus makes the best tasting coffee.  It is smooth brew especially with the foaming action.  I like that it has several size options, especially since I normally use a tall travel mug.  With any size pod that you use, once it is brewed you can just push the button to add more coffee to your cup and press the button to turn off the flow.  It is a pretty smart machine as it reads the markings on the pod to determine what type of coffee you are brewing.  This coffee is way better than the k-cups that I have been using for years.  Bonus was the milk frother, a fun addition to your coffee.  Just pour the milk in and it will froth the milk and turn itself off when finished.  It also has the option of a cold milk froth or a heated milk froth.  I used almond milk and it worked great, hot and cold.  However, I only gave it 4 stars because of the following reasons:  1.   you can only use their pods Nespresso pods which are pricey.  They need to make a pod that you can fill with the coffee of your choice.  It is nice that their pods are recyclable.   2.  After brewing there is always a small ring of coffee in a groove around the pod holder and it needs to be wiped out after use.  I'm not sure if that is normal or not?  3.  You can't just make a cup of hot water for tea as other machines allow you to make hot water without a pod. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5.0,-1

"After using the original Nespresso line for years and I decided to give the Vertuo Line a shot.  The bottom line is I still prefer the original for espresso, but the Vertuo for long brews.

"•	I love this coffee! The machine uses a “centrifuge” technique that creates crema as it brews. I’m not exactly sure how it works, but the product that comes out is amazing. The Vertuo heats up extremely fast and the brew time is quick. The water tank holds 60 oz of water. This machine has a swiveling water takes so it doesn’t take up as much counter space as larger models. This model does not have a storage bin for used cartridges like my old Nespresso model. The VertuoPlus creates 5 different sizes of capsules: Alto(14oz), Mug(7.7oz), Gan Lungo(5.07oz), Double Espresso(2.7oz) and Espresso(1.35oz). My favorite of the sizes are the Espresso and Double Espresso models. They are simply amazing for so little prep time. To think that you can have a good shot of espresso from a machine in less than a minute start to finish is remarkable. My machine came with an Aeroccino frother. It is very easy to use, but doesn’t create a lot of foam. It is enough for a latte, but nowhere near enough for a cappuccino. The froth on the cold foam function on the aeroccino, lasts long enough to look pretty during presentation, but then is gone.  At the time of this review, there are no organic pod options available, but Nespresso does have a filter pod that you can add your own grounds to. Overall an amazing machine and an amazing cup of coffee. I would not recommend the aeroccino frother. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5.0,-1

"I am a strictly latte only drinker. I love lattes that verge on being a dessert! The Nespresso Vertuo Plus makes the most rich and decadent lattes and the milk frother just puts it over the top. I use almond milk only and it works just as well as dairy milk would. The included pods are delicious. I think coffee drinkers who don't use milk or creamer will appreciate all the nuanced flavors from the different flavors alone, but since I'm a latte gal, I just know whatever I make is going to taste rich and creamy. I love the simplicity of the machine and it's so user friendly. It looks modern and premium. Upkeep is super simple as well. I look forward to saving money in the long run making my own latte creations (and trust me, you can get as creative as you wish). I highly recommend!

"The Nespresso Vertuo Plus Deluxe Bundle reminds me of our visits to Europe. Many of our hotels would have Nespresso machines in the room. The Vertuo Plus continues on that same lineage with delicious tasting coffee in a variety of sizes and strength options. The difference between Nespresso and other single serve coffees is stark. The crema on the Vertuo is second to none. It’s a perfect cup every time. I’m shocked by how flavorful and fresh each cup tastes. I also appreciate Nespresso’s recycling program for their capsules. They recognize the importance of caring for the planet and I appreciate that very much. If you’re looking for a single serve coffee maker, this is the one.

I am still amazed that I can now have fresh brewed coffee at home that tastes like it came from a coffee shop.    I was also very excited when I saw the milk frother came with this bundle.

I adore how this machine actually looks not just how it functions, so elegant design, very neat and slim that it won’t occupy a huge space on the counter. The cups holder can be placed in different levels that any cup would easily fits. It comes with the starter kit with different capsules and honestly to me making coffee cannot be easier or more enjoyable with just pressing a single button i get my morning coffee in no time! No setting no measuring and no cleaning mess as all the used capsules will go into a can at the back to empty later!

"If your looking to make espresso at home, then look no further. This machine would make a great addition to any kitchen. First off I would recommend, to read all the manual. I learned a lot from it. With that being said, this machine is very easy to use. Only the capsules made for this machine can be used, because the machine actually reads the capsule and it determines how many ounces to make by the capsules. It’s also got different adjustments, for cup sizes. The cup platform can be removed and placed back on different levels. The espresso machine has a very nice sleek and modern look. It is actually a lot smaller in size then I was expecting and looks so good on the counter. Not taking up a huge amount of space. The water canister is huge. It will hold a lot of water. The added milk frother is a separate device, it’s not very loud and is the perfect addition to my espresso. I can make everything I want at home now. One other big thing about the capsules they are recyclable. And the machine came with a recyclable bag. I’ve been holding on to each one and glad to be able to recycle the capsules. I love the look though, I got the red espresso machine and it stands out so nice on my counter. It’s also been a huge hit with company, I’m always so excited to offer my guests espresso. The machine isn’t to loud and it has impressive heating times. So far it’s been a wonderful addition, I’ve not experienced any issues with it. And I would be happy to recommend.

"For starters, this coffee will be much better than anything from a K Cup. If you want larger superior quality American coffee, and want to use a pod system - this by far is your best bet.

I also appreciate the auto shut off feature, especially being busy on the go. The two main downsides we have had is that it's a pain to store the coffee pods. They're a bit of an odd shape and just take up space whether you leave them in their boxes or take them out. The other downside is that that taste of the coffee isn't for everyone.

"I’m a huge coffee drinker. I own several coffee machines but this one is by far my favorite. I’m impressed with how tasteful the coffee is. I’ve tried all of the coffee and espresso blends and all of them are delicious. I love that I have so many coffee options and styles to choose from, and with the Aeroccino I can get really creative with my coffee and espresso recipes. The design is beautiful and doesn’t take up a ton of room on my countertop.  The Aeroccino makes hot or cold milk froth and it’s easy to clean up afterwards. Having all my coffee needs at home is extremely convenient for me. I would recommend this product. It’s fast, easy to use, convenient, provides different coffee and espresso sizes and blends, and it taste delicious. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5.0,-1

"This 6 QT Nuwave Brio air fryer is really nice! It is spacious & surprisingly easy to use! It has all touch screen settings, indictor lights & a lightweight, easy to use/clean basket. I love the pre-heat setting & all of the recipes included within the instruction booklet! So far I have made: boneless chicken wing bites, 16 bone in chicken wings on the bone, two servings of frozen french fries & surprisingly a grilled cheese sandwich! Personally, we followed the frozen fries & grilled cheese suggested times & temps exactly & they were perfect. For our two types of chicken, I used the suggested temp but increased the cooking time until it was crispier (my preference). for the grilled cheese, it was fine, it took the same time as pan frying. The kids like to do it with the air fryer, because they can do it independently (age 10 & 12. I stood by, but I don't like them using the stove much yet lol).  I can't wait to try some other items like steak, hamburgers & some desert egg rolls (deserts are also in the booklets recipes!). I attached pictures of before use & after making the bone in wings. I am shocked at how much grease dropped out & how crispy they were! My family & a few of my elderly neighbors have truly been enjoying this air fryer!

"I received the 6 quart Nu wave brio air fryer and im in love!  I have used this for so many things from chicken wings, pork chops and steak to a grilled cheese sandwich, which was the best I ever had! It can air fry, broil, roast, grill, bake, reheat and dehydrate. Comes with a basket divider so you can cook two things at once. so simple to use took me less than 15 minutes to take out of box and start cooking. great way to cook healthy food that tastes perfect.  You get fried foods without using oil so you skip all the extra calories. Can cook from frozen without defrosting so perfect for last-minute meals. Has digital temperature and time controls, preset menu selections, preheat, reheat also has wattage control. can cook at temperatures between 100 and 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Easy to clean it is nonstick and the removable parts are dishwasher safe.  The fry basket has holes all around the sides which allows food to be cook from air flow from all directions so food is evenly cooked. I also received several recipes to get me started which I have tried out many. I definitely have cut down the time my oven was previously used, the air fryer is so much easier to use and cleaning is a breeze and food tastes great. The brio can replace your deep fryer, oven, stove, grill even your toaster! I would definitely recommended to to anyone looking to make healthier meals or just all-around great tasting food!

"I have been looking for an air fryer because I want to change my eating habits and the way I cook. This air fryer definitely helps to reduce my usage of cooking oil while cooking. Before I used a lot of oil, but now that I have this air fryer no more cooking oil needed. The size is just about right, you can put 4 pieces of chicken at a time. It works very good, if you have more time and want your food perfect (not over cook at the top and not under cook in the middle) especially chicken or any meat you can set it in low temperature and set the time higher. It works very good too for fries as I used it for the fries and it cooked perfectly. Very easy to clean up and setup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",4.0,-1
"I seasoned a 3lb chicken and set it in the fridge overnight. In the morning I put it in my NuWave Brio Digital Air Fryer. The air fryer comes with a manual which was handy since I was a first time user. For every pound your suppose to leave in 10-12 min, I set the time @ 375 and to turn the chicken over on the breast side for half the time and the other half covered in foil. I did end up leaving my chicken in a lot longer than the estimated time just because I like my chicken well cooked and crispy, I also ended up taking the foil off at the end. I found it cooked faster that way.I really love this machine, it's very easy to use and easy to clean. I can't wait to try out various type of food with it.

Whether it be poultry, fish, or meat it takes the guess work out of temperature and time. The fries came out crispy and no grease! My son literally said ""these are the best fries I have had!"". Although, its big we have the counterspace so it wasnt a huge deal. I can also store it somewhere if I didnt want it out.

"I've been making fries almost every day with this air fryer. They turn out great. No more oil in my fries. It took a couple of tries to get it all figured out but, once we figured it out, it is a snap to make golden brown French fries. I've included a picture of how fresh cut french fries turn out. It has preset menus for different items such as fresh cut fries and frozen fries, chicken and various other foods. All you have to do is preheat the fryer, add your food and hit start. The timer automatically starts with the preset features. It also includes a menu book that gives you different menus and what settings to use. Another plus for this fryer is the fact that it can be set at 1 of 3 different watts. The standard is 1800 and I haven't had any issues with tripping a braker while using other appliances at the same time. The 6 quart capacity holds a lot of food. Another pro is that even though the fries are piled on top of each other the air circulates and cooks them all evenly. The only con about this fryer is the way there's a button on the main pot that you push to open the tray and if you accidentally push it after it opens, the wire basket can fall out and the pot falls on the floor. It's nothing that would lower my opinion on the fryer. You just have to pay attention. It only happened once it hasn't happened since the first time. The LED display is very easy to see and I have no problems seeing the timers. It also includes a divider that you can place inside the basket to cook different items separately. This fryer is well built and I have confidence it will last years.  I will be using this fryer more than I use my stove now. I will now be able to healthy meals that my doctor informed me that I needed to start eating. We love it and the food tastes great. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to eat healthy and great tasting foods. If I could, I rate this fryer as a 10 star rating. We love it.

"I'm all about cooking home cooked meals, but sometimes things happen, so you don't have time to get dinner done. So I decided to try out the nuwave 6 qt air fryer and I am HIGHLY impressed. It cooks so many things in a matter of minutes that would take you longer to cook in the oven or on the stove top. It heats up super fast and has different temps. Not to mention, it's not too big so it saves counter top space and is easy to clean! This was definitely a good investment for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5.0,-1

I literally got this yesterday and used it last night. I was surprised at how much food I could cook in it!  We started of slow with some frozen precooked chicken wings. They turned out so juicy inside  & crisp on the outside. Then we cooked fries. They were perfectly cooked also! The buttons on top are easy enough for my 12 yo son to use.

"Im very happy with my NuWave Brio Air Fryer. The 6 quart basket allows me to feed a big crew for enteraining or something a little more light and simple for dinner with my wife. The first thing I wanted to cook was a chicken and it did not disappoint. The settings are very easy to use and it came with recipes that made for a delicious and healthy meal. I'm very impressed with the one touch preheat setting for searing which hold flavors in. Check this out! Here's a list of all the things this air fryer can do: Grill, Air-fry, roast, broil, re-heat, bkae, warm, toast and dehydrate. WOW! This takes care of all your cookign needs and it's fast and cooks evenly. There's also a removable divider so you can cook 2 things at once. It was very easy to clean too.

"I have to admit, I was scared to use this at first. The Nuwave 6qt Brio air fryer is actually easy to use. The owner's manual is full of helpful hints and wonderful recipes. Once you turn it on, it makes little noises and while you are choosing the settings but pretty quiet while it is cooking. I chose to make frozen thick cut steak fries as my first attempt using this. I mentioned the sounds in case any one has a Mama's Boy dog at home. Mine wasn't sure if he should alert me to danger or not but after the steak fries were done, he figured it was safe.

I love so many things about this air fryer I don’t know where to begin! The NuWave Brio 6 QT air fryer has multiple wattage for power (up to 1800) so you can adjust that temp depending on what you cook. Also it is very easy to clean plus even comes with a basket divider so you can cook 2 different types of food at the same time. Most of all I love that this model air fryer comes with a preheat selection. My previous air fryer didn’t have that feature and it’s so helpful. Also I noticed the NuWave Brio didn’t dry out chicken I had to cook from raw like my other air fryer used to do all the time. Definitely 5 star rating and a high recommendation for the NuWave Brio!

"I have used several air fryers before and this one in particular was somewhat different. I noticed that you just pull the handle out instead of using the slide button on the handle to remove it (the slide button is what releases the inside basket for easier dumping of your food). This is one feature I didn’t care so much for. I’m also not a big fan of the preheat feature. I’d rather turn it on and expect it to be hot enough to use right then and there as opposed to waiting. I did like however, the cooking guide on it which tells you which temperature you’ll need for whatever you’re cooking. This air fryer also doesn’t take up much counter space, it’s more tall than wide. It beeps to let you know when it’s reached the temperature it’s set to or when your food is done. The basket is pretty large and holds a decent amount of food. This also includes a divider which separates your food when cooking. It does a great job at cooking foods evenly (I shake the basket halfway through) to ensure even cooking. It’s very simple and easy to clean (wipe outside with a damp cloth) and the basket & holder can be washed with soap and water. I’ve listed the pros and cons about this unit and hopefully it’s enough for you to make an informative decision on purchasing it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",4.0,-1

"I really like the NuWave Brio 6 quart air fryer. I found the air fryer to be very easy to use. I like how it has a Pre Heat button that helps to reach the desired temperature before adding your food to the basket. I also like how you can easily adjust the temperature settings, and it is very easy to set the timer. The air fryer also comes with Menu buttons to cook your favorite foods such as french fries, nuggets, chicken, or fish. There is also a pause function which is great when you need to shake the food in the basket, or need to turn the food over for even browning. The air fryer comes with a large basket which can hold plenty of food such as french fries, and it comes with a divider for the basket in case you would like to cook two different items at one time. The first time I used the product, I cooked a whole chicken in it. I followed the recipe in the included instruction booklet. While putting the butter mixture underneath the chicken skin, the skin tore because it was a little on the thin side, but the chicken still came out moist and very tender. I have also made chicken tenders, wings, potato wedges, and tonight I plan on air frying some fish fillets. I really like how well the air fryer gives things such as wings a great crispy brown texture on the outside, and still being moist and tender on the inside. I also found that clean up is a breeze. I have been hand washing the basket, the basket net, and the base tray using hot water, dish soap, and a non abrasive sponge, then using a damp cloth and paper towel to wipe off the outside. So far I have not experienced any issues with the air fryer, and all of the meals I have cooked have turned out great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5.0,-1

"The NuWave Air Fryer has become my best friend. I use it for practically every meal! It is so easy to use and clean! The settings have temp ranges from 100*F to 400*F. Which is amazing because you can dehydrate certain foods! I rely on using the preheat before cooking because it gets the whole basket hot so it can circulate. I suggest cleaning after every use, cuts down on messes and clean time. Best fryer ever, hands down! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5.0,-1
"The NuWave 6 Qt Brio Air Fryer is of excellent quality based on the amazing capacity it has to evenly distribute heat.

Later, I cooked fries for my kiddos and they came out crispy and delicious.  I like how the air Fryer prevents food from coming out soggy.

"I was really excited to try the NuWave 6 Qt Brio Air Fryer because I wanted to start eating healthier. This was a large capacity air fryer big enough for me and my family. It has a pre- heat function that will reach the desired temperature before I start cooking  my food, also has six preset options on top with most popular foods like fresh fries, frozen fries, chicken nuggets, steak, chicken, and fish making it really easy and convenient to just press the button and walk away. I really enjoy that my food is being cooked by just hot air (dehydrates) with no oils added! I tried both fresh and frozen fries and I couldn't believe how good they came out so crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle just perfect!  My overall thoughts this is perfect size for your counter space, less mess to clean, easy to clean, I can cook multiple foods at one time by dividing the middle, preheat and reheat buttons, adjustable temperature, and has digital timer.

On the top there is a row of commonly cooked foods with the temperature and time so I followed that for frozen fries and they were perfect. I guess what I like the most is actually safety.

"We bought the round to go under the dining room table. We've had it since November (3 months) and it gets a fair amount of traffic with walking and chairs being pulled in and out.

The pros: nice neutral color, soft on bare feet, warm, easy to vacuum on high roller setting.

The cons: startes shedding little fibers that get all over the floor and on xlothes if you are on the floor, woven tips are coming up with wear. You can't see the fibers against the wood floors, but we have white bookcases in the dining room and I have to dust the rug fibers daily because they are really obvious against white. My baby is crawling and the fibers get on her pants, but dust off easily. The fibers have not triggered my allergies so I'm glad about that too.

I plan to move this to a lower traffic area of the house eventually because I really like it, I just wish it had lasted longer before showing such wear. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",3.0,-1

I have tried onion rings, fries, tator tots, desserts and my favorite...bacon.  It cleans up easily.  My only problem is that I have one more large kitchen appliance to find room for.

"I am so happy with my Nuwave Brio! This thing is huge ! Love the touchscreen display and how everything is clearly labeled and it's easy to choose from the given options.

The divider allows you to cook to separate things at the same time and you can make homemade french fries in less than 30 minutes. ! CONS: the biggest con for me is that it's hard to clean up the bottom basket after making certain foods (like air fried chicken) I wish there were disposable liners so that it would make clean-up easier. Other than that this air fryer has saved me so much time, and since there's no oil involved it's healthier too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",4.0,-1

"My wife and I have wanted an air fryer since we first heard about the health benefits of using it: tasting like fried food without the extra grease!! When the opportunity came to get one, we chose the 6-quart Nuwave Brio Digital Air Fryer because of the size and it appeared to be easy to use and clean. It has lived up to our first impressions! It has six separate presets for fries, frozen fries, nuggets, steak, poultry and fish or you can create your own temperature and time that suits a different food item. The enclosed booklet shows step-by-step usage instructions and provides several recipes; my wife was also able to find several popular recipe sites online that offer various air fryer recipes to expand our meal options. It did take a few uses to get used to the different settings and create our own; I feel that my wife and I are now accustomed to using this fryer and the “learning phase” is passed. These simple steps will make first time use run much smoother: Turn ON the fryer. Set PRE-HEAT. Press START (a step that is easily forgotten). The pre-heat takes about 15 mins at the default temperature of 360; this can be changed prior to pressing START. Once it pre-heats, the screen will display “READY & TIME”. When there are 5 minutes left of pre-heat, the fryer will beep once, and the countdown begins and flashes with each minute past. After preheating, you can open the fryer and insert your food and press START to continue the cooking process at the selected temperature and time. Most foods will require you to pause the cooking and either flip the food or shake the fryer basket for even cooking. Pressing START after doing this, is a step we forgot several times! The best part is that fryer turns off after it cooks; therefore, you can do other things while the food is cooking, We made grilled turkey and cheese sandwiches, French fries with tenders(we used the enclosed divider to make these are one time) and a whole chicken. All, our proteins were moist inside, the foods were all crispy on the outside. The whole chicken was our favorite; it tasted like the rotisserie chicken you would purchase in a market. Clean up is a breeze; the food residue comes easily off the fryer. Although it is dishwasher safe, we washed ours by hand, after letting it soak in warm water, since it was easy to clean. A few remarks I would like to mention are that the fryer sounds like a microwave so it can be on the louder end yet after using it a few times, this noise was not apparent. Another is that upon first use, the fryer emitted an odd chemical odor that was not evident the other times of usage. Lastly, because it is 6 quarts, it would require ample counter space. I would highly recommend this air fryer for someone who likes to make healthier versions of their favorite fried foods without all the mess and multiple cooking tools they may need. Additionally, it is a great appliance to have during the summer months when a typical oven would make the kitchen overly hot! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5.0,-1

"As a member of Bazaarvoice TryItSampling I received for free to sample and give my honest feedback on a NuWave 6qt Brio Air Fryer. We are a family that loves our fried foods and with the NuWave we get to eat our foods in a much healthier way. What I like most is you can cook two dishes with the included fryer divider. The built quality is top notch and I have had no problems with the product. The pan basket has non stick coating, with no PFOA, ensures perfect results every time. The Brio has the ability to distribute heat evenly every single time to all parts of your meal while minimizing the temperature fluctuation. it has an advanced LCD display that tells you the exact temperature your meals are being cooked at so no guessing the cooking temperature. Great product would highly recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5.0,-1

"I have to admit, that before trying the NuWave 6Qt. Brio, I was one of those people who thought that air fryers were just another gimmicky kitchen gadget that sits around, taking up space, and when used produced mediocre cooking results at best. I had heard all the hype about these things, but never believed any of it. Within the past 6 months I have committed myself to healthier lifestyle. That includes healthy eating. It was great at first, but I quickly found myself overwhelmed with the amount of prep and cooking it involves to feed myself and my family, and I grew bored of cooking the same things over and over again because it was the easiest and quickest to make. After much deliberation, I finally decided to jump on the air fryer bandwagon with the NuWave 6Qt. Brio. I was a little overwhelmed at first. There was a lot of information to read on how to use my new air fryer. I read and reread the manual, the recipe book and even looked online for how to videos (I may be a bit of an overachiever!). I decided to cook easy things like frozen nuggets, fries and corn dogs my first few tries. Surprisingly, it was super simple to use, and the results...amazing! The NuWave 6Qt. Brio has become my most used kitchen tool. I use it multiple times a day, every day, and I absolutely love it! Not only can I make my kids things like nuggets, pizza rolls and fries in a fraction of the time, but I get the same results as if I were cooking them in a frying pan full of oil! They come out to hot, crispy perfection. I have since started to cook my healthier foods, so I can once again enjoy crispy, air fried foods that taste just as guilty as the fattier fried foods do. My favorite is to cook up some air fried veggies (whatever veggies I have on hand). I put my veggies in the fryer, spray them lightly with olive oil, salt and pepper, and while they are frying, cook up some scrambled eggs and turkey bacon or sausage. This makes the most delicious, satisfying breakfast and it's so quick and easy. Not only am I eating healthier (and loving my food!), but I feeding my kids nutritious, delicious meals that they gobble up, and are none the wiser. If you're suspicious of the air fryer trend happening right now, don't be! Don't wait another second. Get the NuWave 6Qt. Brio! I promise, you won't regret it!

"I love the beauty of an air fryer, it makes meals so much easier for me and the taste is still amazing and much better for you. My only issue , more just a personal preference is this fryer is large and bulky.  I do not keep mine on the counter so I store it inside a cabinet and sometimes I have to fight this big fryer into there. The actual cooking has been delicious and easy to navigate.  I love the buttons are easy to push, and the screen display is easy to see. This air fryer is also good for the busy parent because it makes freezer food so tasty.  The divider it comes with ,makes it so easy to make my son nuggets and french fries . It is also fairly easy to clean, the piece where food sits on with all the little holes can be a pain to clean but it is manageable.  Overall , I love this air fryer and I am always enjoying new recipes in it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",4.0,-1

"This is seriously the best thing since sliced bread! I have owned other air fryers and toaster oven/air fryer combos but the nuwave brio knocks it out of the ball park!

The food it crunchy, flavorful and healthier so I feel great serving it to my family and I’m also confident that they will love it. Super easy and quick to use with many common food items already programmed and ready to go at the push of a button in usually 15 minutes or less.

"This air fryer is a must have in my kitchen.  I have not stopped using this since I got it.  One thing does it all and it’s quick and healthy, no added oil or butter.  It bakes, grills, fries, reheats, dehydrates, roast, broil, warms and even toasts.  It has 6 pre-programmed recipes, one touch pre-heat function and a precise temperature control which are all even to use.  My family loves fries and finally we can makes fries that are crispy and not greasy.   everything we made, chicken, pork, hamburgers, peppers and veggies have all come out so juicy and delicious.  The manual that comes with the unit explains how to use and clean, everything is very easy to follow.  Clean up is easy to, you can put the base tray in the dishwasher on the top rack or hand wash, which I like to do, and wipe the outside with a damp cloth.

"I love the design of my Nuwave 6qt Brio. It can easily fit a 5 to 6 pound whole chicken. I've cooked veggies, like broccoli and brussel sprouts. When it comes to meats, it comes out nice and juicy and fast. So far I've cooked chicken breast, chicken thighs and hamburgers.  I hardly have to use any cooking fat or oil.  Also, I made a chickpeas snack with bbq spices. It's a perfect cooking vessel. The possibilities are endless. I love it. The unit itself is so easy to use. You can use preprogram settings or just set your own temperature and time and when time is up it stops automatically. So you can set it and walk away. How easy is that? You can adjust at any time depending on what you are cooking. Also, cleanup is a brease. I have a feeling I will use the nuwave air-fryer more than my oven because it's so quick and easy to cleanup.

"I was excited to try the NuWave -6Qt Brio air fryer.  We are vegetarian, so I primarily wanted to use it for veggie sides such as french fries, onion rings etc. It works well enough.  Foods do come out crisp.  I already have a convection toaster oven that I keep out on my counter.  It pretty much does the same job of the air fryer and more.  This machine was way heavier than I was expecting.  I don't plan on leaving it out in my kitchen and it is annoying to carry up and down to the basement.

"I have used my air fryer multiple times since it arrived. I love to cook at home but am always rushed in the evenings, so I am always trying to find easy ways to cook tasty as well as healthy food. The air fryer allows me to fry or grill meats and vegetables in half the time stove cooking takes. It is so easy to use and does not create the smoke, splashing or hot oil burning smell in my house. I think it is a much healthier way to cook, the 6 qt size can fit a couple of patties or enough chicken to easily feed 2-4 people, any more and you need need a larger size fryer.

"I have been using the air fryer for a few weeks now. I had a bit of a learning curve. Maybe it was just me but now that I have been using it, the instructions make more sense. At first I didn't fully understand the operation steps of the fryer. I was a little confused on the countdown after the unit is preheated - the pause would not work. In this case the pause is not intended to be used, just open the basket to fill. I read plenty of reviews prior to use. I was concerned with the comments about the interior rusting/coating peeling. I contacted NuWave prior to using with this concern and this is what they suggested to avoid: Spray interior with oil prior to each use and clean with warm soapy water. NuWave is very easy to contact by phone and the representatives seem to be very knowledgeable concerning the product. Even though it says it is dishwasher safe, I do not plan on washing it in there. I got the impression this would be the best for the basket. It is not difficult to clean after an interior soaks with warm soapy water. I did not hear this from NuWave but my mother in law told me that some of the oil sprays have some harmful chemicals that can contribute to the peeling of the protective coating. Therefore, I am just using an air mister that I put olive oil into for spraying the interior surfaces. We are still experimenting but we have made fresh wings, a whole ham (wrapped in foil for the first half of cooking time), fish sticks, home made tortilla chips, chicken strips, and fresh chicken. So far we think everything we have made tastes much better than baked in the oven. Also, it cooks much faster. Remember to stop and shake or flip the contents every few minutes after the items begin to cook/brown to ensure even cooking [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5.0,-1

"Omg I love this rug. I needed something big, natural, and not too expensive for my kitchen. Found this and it arrived just a few days later. It was packed perfectly and was in mint condition. The color and texture is very sophisticated. The boarder gives it a more interesting and finished look. Quality seems spot-on so far; no shedding. And it laid flat immediately after unpacking. I'm trying to stop myself for getting the same one for the living room. How many jute rugs is too many jute rugs? First time ordering from this vendor. Great experience. Will definitely do it again.

"As much as I wanted to love this cool kitchen gadget, it really wasn't that useful for our family. I will say this would be wonderful for someone who lives alone and really isn't into cooking anything that takes a lot of time. I did try this for making bagged tater tots and it worked great! We just rarely eat foods like that. I found it useless for cooking meats because you can't layer raw meats in the air fryer. That does not benefit our family. My husband used this for reheating pizza a day after it was eaten, he said it worked rather well. While this isn't a product I particularly liked, I think it would work great for the right person.

I received this product in exchange for an honest review.  This product has been great so far.  I used it to cook fries and onion rings.  Both came out crispy and done.

"I received my Nuwave 6qt Brio air fryer a few weeks ago and I've used it almost everyday since.   I've always wanted an air fryer and I'm so happy with the Nuwave brand.   The controls are really simple and it comes with an easy to understand instruction booklet with minimal set up.   The removable drawer and basket both have a non stick coating that makes cleaning up really easy.   I've been looking up recipes online and there's really no limit to what you can cook with this air fryer.   So far I've cooked fried pickles,  home made french fries,  and chicken nuggets without having to use any oil.   I feel more health conscious feeding my family of six fried foods that are made with my air fryer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",4.0,-1
"I am very thankful that I received this air fryer, it’s been an amazing addition to my kitchen. So far, I have used it to cook chicken on a few occasions and it has worked perfectly. The chicken comes out crisp and juicy, never over cooked. Cleaning it’s less than complicated, just a couple of pieces you have to wash. it is a little big in size, so make sure you have the space to accommodate.

"The Nuwave Brio is the future of kitchen appliances. It’s a wonderful innovation that provides convenience and variety to the modern family of today. There are numerous cooking features which are the best benefit of the Nuwave. It’s able to roast a chicken, bake a pie, dehydrate fruit and slow cook a casserole. I was initially overwhelmed by the number of digital settings. However, it was not difficult to use after thoroughly reading the user guide. I highly recommend that consumers reference the guidelines for time and temperature. The innovative aspect is the reduction in cook time, which does not impact taste, temperature, or quality of the food. I would recommend this product for any household. It’s completely reinvented mealtimes for my family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5.0,-1
"This is the first air fryer I have ever used and I love it! I've made the perfect steak, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. When it comes to frozen foods I love using this over the microwave because it doesn't take up much more time and the food taste so much better, with crispier textures. I also use this to reheat leftovers. It comes with some recipe ideas and instructions that are simple to follow. It has different settings to choose from depending on what you're planning to make. I made french fries from raw potatoes and loved not having to stress over hot oil on the stove top. The basket comes apart and is easy to clean. My husband and I plan to use this to make healthier meals for our family. We have it easily accessible on the kitchen counter, it is large but the square design is accommodating.

"So far I have cooked salmon filets, 1/2” 14oz lamb steak, French fries and hash browns. For the hasbrowns, I should have used the patties because they’re pretty oily and would have cooked well, but I used frozen shredded hash browns with no oiling up, so it was a disaster. I followed the recipe for the salmon filets, flipping halfway, and I found I needed to cook them several minutes longer before the inside was cooked. I cooked the lamb using the “steak” setting, but cooking it a full 15 minutes. It came out beautifully juicy, about medium-rare. ",4.0,-1

OK... The nuwave works great. HOWEVER its only under warranty for ONE year. My nuwave lasted only 13 months. I took exceptional care of the device. The internal wiring burnt up. I read many other reports. There were many claims of their nuwave air fryer lasting the same up to 18 months. This is nonsense. They seem to be designed and made to last a short time just over the 1 year warranty limit. There are a few great air fryers on line that give a 2 year warranty. I will definitely try one of those. I will not buy another nuwave.,5.0,-1

"We bought the cream w/ tan border and the colors were exactly as advertised. The rug is not a ""perfect"" straight rectangle. It's hardly noticeably but since it's braided jute some areas have more stretch..but we do not mind at all. It's the handmade rustic look we were going for.

Good value considering the size - well under a couple of hundred with free shipping 
Color is not a true grey,( ofcourse grey is a tricky color depending on the light) more like medium brown inside with natural light brown jute color on the border

Construction looked good For sweet potato fries Great I dont eat meat I bought it as an alternative for steaming veggies with that I was rather disappointed. I tried different times and temps and it kind of trashed the veggies roasting out the benefits of the veggies. One thing that can be improved is a better way to collect oils expelled from the food.  The present method of collection and cleaning the pull out  slider drawer is a big pain for people that have to hand wash the drawer which  dont have a dish washer.  For a person that eats meats and prepared foods is a good unit. I am still in the process of getting more familiar with the unit maybe up the road it will get better.,3.0,-1

It is also not a perfect rectangle, I guess if you are going for a more rustic feel, would be OK. Not for me.",1.0,-1
"The air fryer worked well the first few uses. Now it stops after pre-heating, and beeps with an error message. It needs to sit and rest for about 5 minutes, then once restarting it will finish cooking the food. When it works, it does a pretty good job with the food.",2.0,-1
"I have really enjoyed using the NuWave 6 Qt Brio air fryer. This is my first air fryer as I was looking for a healthier alternative to frying. It has multiple heat settings and comes with a removable divider to cook two different types of food. I started with fries and have gone on to chicken, veggies, and different types of recipes.I did have a concern with the Teflon flaking/chipping off but so far that has not been an issue.I soak the plastic pieces in hot soapy water before washing to dislodge any remaining pieces of food. Also great for hot summer months as an alternative to heating up a large oven, Would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5.0,-1
"I've always wanted an airfryer and this one definitely does not disappoint! The unit is slightly large, but not too large to fit nicely on my counter. The display is very nice and comprehensive after a little research with the manual. There is definitely a learning curve when first using the Nuwave Brio. My first batch of fries left much to be desired. But after tweaking the temperature and time, they came out nice and crunchy. I have made fried chicken, baked potatoes, chicken strips, and even a nice ribeye steak for my husband and they all came out perfect. I am giving the Nuwave Brio 4 stars due to the design of the basket. There needs to be something to cushion it when inserting and taking it out. The metal scrapes against each other and I feel like that can easily be fixed. Overall, I would absolutely recommend the Nuwave Brio for anyone who wants a great quality airfryer that makes great food! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",4.0,-1
I got this product and couple of weeks back and just recently used it. I have to say I love that I ca split the basket and fry two things at once!

"I have heard a lot about air fryers and at first i was skeptical of their promises of fast, even cooking with a crisp outside and moist interior. Fried food is delicious but when i factor in the clean up and how gross i feel after i always find at home frying more trouble than its worth. I purchased a toaster oven that had an air fryer function and i wasnt impressed with the results but i was still curious about how the real thing stacked up. After having it in my home for a week i will say im definitely impressed. The foods i tried (breaded fish and fries) worked great. The fish came out crunchy and perfectly cooked and the fries were also great. The chamber heated up quickly(under 5 min) and id say this is a decent size for 2-3 people but any more than id reccommend a larger size as you wouldnt be saving any time having to make sever smaller batches. Although the manual says it can cook without any oil id reccommend investing in some kind of spray oil to help with browning. Between that and the basket coming apart clean up is a breeze. Its essentially a convection oven so you can bake in it as well though i havent tried. One thing to note is that the sides of the oven get quite warm and you should keep a good 1-2 feet of space from the vents on the top and back. Id reccommend this to anyone that has the space for it.

"I have been using this to cook almost everyday since I got it. I love this air fryer. It works great and it works quick. The basket is deep so it fits a lot of food inside. The preheat option on this is super fast also. It comes with a recipe book and has a lot of very good recipe ideas to make. It also comes with food divider so if you are cooking more then one thing, you can separate them from each other. I feel like it makes the flavoring of food so good. This is way better then a microwave and faster then an oven. Definitely recommend this air fryer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5.0,-1

"I have been looking for good soft sheets for months- tried 100% cotton and microfiber- cotton was too scratchy, microfiber did not fit well and was too hot.  These are just the right color, fit well, but still too hot- even though they say they are cool.  The pillowcase has a nice decorative pleat- but only on one said- why didn't they put it on both sides of the pillowcase.  And the top sheet has no decorative fold at the top at all- hard to tell the top from the bottom.- it would have looked so much better to have the pleat on both sides of pillow case and the top of the flat sheet.  It would have looked much more elegant.",4.0,1

"Lately having trouble with buying sheets. I purchased an $65 800 count Egyptian cotton sheet set and in one month it started piling. It was a nice Quality and thickness. But it felt like sandpaper even after washing. So I found a deal at Walmart for a 1800 count bamboo set. No where on the package does it say 1800 count. It only says luxury 1800. However, they felt soft immediately to the touch even though they are half the thickness of my original sheets. The sewing is amateur and the side lengths is short. But I only paid $26 for these sheets. So I guess I get what I paid for. I will see how they wear in the next few weeks. I posted a pic to compare the differences in the sets.",3.0,1
A friend of mine recently got an air fryer and spoke so highly about it - so of course I needed to try it out myself. I’ve been very happy with this product from Brio.

Love that this air fryer has a big capacity and I can air fry a whole chicken in it!   The digital display is easy to use.  The basket is fairly easy to clean and I like that I can put it in the dishwasher.  The divider basket is great so I can cook different foods on each side.  My favorite function is how I can pull out the basket during the cooking cycle to check if my food is done and it pauses.  You can put the basket back in and it starts up again automatically.  Great quality air fryer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],5.0,-1
"these are not bamboo sheets, the tag on them says ""bamboo feel fiber"".  they are not 1800 thread count, the name on the package is 1800 luxury sheets. they are extremely thin and the elastic on the fitted sheet isn't even sewn in place (by that I mean the elastic is free to move inside the folded over edge and you can feel it redistributing itself as you put it on the mattress). the only pro is they do fit my mattress, which is the only thing that's true in the description, they are sheets and they are queen size.",1.0,1
The rug looked beautiful and simple on the photos. However when it came I didn't like it at all. I took the lightest color and it just looked dirty. It had a look of an old rug.

"I used my air fryer to “fry” chicken for dinner. I used a breadcrumbs and cracker batter. The chicken took about 30 minutes to cook, as the breasts were very large. My house smelled amazing during cooking. Cleanup was a breeze. The drawer and basket came right out and I was able to wash them both. There was no grease splattering and the chicken came out crispy and super moist. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5.0,-1
"I recently purchased the queen size set in ivory.  The order came two days earlier than expected which was a great surprise. The packaging was very classy and when I opened the zipper to feel the sheets, I could not wait to put them on my bed. They felt like silky butter. After following the washing and drying instructions, I started placing them on my bed, which is a very thick 16 inch gel mattress and they fit very well. As I was putting the pillow cases on, I noticed that the stitching on the outer edges were bunched up and there was no way to straighten them out as the directions say no iron. I decided to email customer service about my situation and within minutes of sending the email, they responded back.  That alone was amazing to me, especially in today's world where great customer service does not seem to exist anymore.  They told me that they would be sending me out a new set of pillow cases the very next day. The following morning, I recieved an email with the tracking number and their apologizes again for the unfortunate situation.  The sheets are very soft and wrinkle free.  I am a hot sleeper and definately felt a great difference sleeping on them.  I am not exactly sure what the material is due to the fact that the label says 100% bamboo feel fiber, but never the less, they did the job of keeping me cool and comfortable all night.  These sheets are very thin, so keep in mind if you have any print on your mattress pad or pillows, it will show through with the ivory color. I don't think it would with any of the darker colors.  Other than that, I would reccomend these sheets for those who have night sweats as well as those who just want a great nights sleep.  Thank you again Okao for your superb customer service and wonderful sheet sets!

"The 6 quart Brio Airfryer is an amazing kitchen device to have handy. It preheats quickly and cooks quickly as well. There are a lot of kids in my house. They like frozen foods. I detest when they microwave things like chicken nuggets. 8 minutes in the airfryer and they're crispy and just as if they came out of the oven (but in about half the time). There's no oil so there's no popping and splashing. You just put it in once it's preheated and if you aren't flipping or shaking part way through you just leave it be. I also cooked raw chicken breast in it and it came out great. My only complaint, if it's really a complaint at all, is that I wish it had a dividing rack that went horizontally instead of just the divider that goes down the middle.

I just ordered more for my son's house for Christmas gifts so when I visit I can sleep on them there. My night sweats have just about stopped and the sheets stay totally dry. My husband says they are so soft and he loves them too.,5.0,-1

"I'm very happy with the NuWave Brio 6 Qt Digital Air Fryer! I really like the design of it. The top is angled downward, making it easy to see and use the touch pad. It comes with a great instruction booklet, which includes some delicious recipes! I was unaware I could make desserts in it!  I started with something simple and cooked some tator tots and fries.  I love them crispy, so I was eager to see if the air fryer would do the same job as when they're cooked in oil. They were delicious! They were crunchy on the outside and nice and soft inside. Next on the menu, chicken legs, then wings. I had to cook them longer than suggested, but have since found, if I adjust the temperature I can get them done a little quicker. They were nice and juicy.The baskets and trays are easy to clean. I washed them by hand, but you can put them in the top rack of the dishwasher. I have joined a couple of online groups and have picked up a lot of recipes and great tips! There are so many tasty things I never imagined I could cook, in this air fryer!

"I got this product couple of days back and started using from day1. I have baked chicken drumsticks and they out very yummy with no or very very minimal oil sprinkle. Time it took to cook the dishes were so fast and taste wise very very tastier. Air fryer is easy to clean and portable to carry on travels as well.

"I am obsessed with my NuWave Brio! I’ve had this air fryer for a week now and have used it 5 times. I love fried foods and appreciate that this air fryer gives me a healthier alternative to eating them. My chicken wings come out perfectly crisp every time, albeit I just about double the cooking time from what is suggested on the appliance. The best part about this air fryer is that it has a digital menu display. The menu is truly self intuitive and I had no issues navigating and using it my first time to cook homemade sweet potato fries. This was truly a stark difference in experience from using other competitors. The simplicity in the menu is self explanatory and makes choosing the settings a breeze. It doesn’t leave me confused with how to cook my food. They come out how I want them to after the first cook whereas with others I’d end up have to recook them again because I didn’t choose the appropriate settings the first time. The trick To getting your food to cook evenly is to pause the fryer half way into cooking and flip the food then continue air frying until finished. ",5.0,-1

I hate to spoil this love fest however my Brio air fryer was way below expectation based on the commercial I saw on TV.  I fried chicken thighs.

"The Brio air fryer is the real deal! The choice of wattage in addition to all of the cooking option buttons make this machine easy enough for anyone to use. The menu buttons are clear and easy for these old eyes to see. It cooks much more evenly than others, and it has a preheat function. The capacity of the basket is larger than any I’ve seen (enough to cook a whole fryer) and they made the bottom basket removable for cleaning which is so convenient! It is also very quiet, making this my go to appliance (beating out the microwave, which is a huge feat in itself). My only con is totally on me: after setting the time and temp I have accidentally hit the on button instead of start, making me have to reset everything. All in all this is a great little machine! I have been able to make most of my food using the Brio and couldn’t be happier with the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5.0,-1

Im a naturopathic doctor and acupuncturist. Between both professions nutrition is a major focus. I counsel my patients extensively about finding healthier alternatives to things they love and use. One of the biggest issues Ive encountered is getting folks in SE North Carolina to give up their fried foods. They suffer with hypertension gout and arthritis but refuse to let go of unhealthy foods/cooking methods. On my Facebook health blog Health Is Wealth I post about these healthier alternatives. I purchased an air fryer so I could demonstrate how much healthier it is in lieu of traditional frying methods. I deal with a culturally diverse family patient population and social media audience. They love my honest reviews of products. Today I posted about how to make Caribbean Jerk Chicken using only olive oil spray seasoning and the air fryer. It was a success. I wish I could upload the photos. This product works exactly as described. The Brio air fryer can look intimidating to use but its quite simple. I do have to play with the cook times since I cook far more than what is listed in the manual they provide. It creates the best pizzas......nice soft crusts and well cooked toppings. I made BBQ and air fried chicken and pork chops. Ive prepared sausage Caribbean pate vegetables and then some in it. Ive had no malfunctions the past 6 weeks since using this product. Cleanup is easy. If I could make a recommendation it would be to add a tiered cooking rack so you can cook on 2 wire rack layers instead of having to place items on the bottom of the cook pot. This was a great investment and is truly doctor approved.,5.0,-1

"First, I'd like to say this machine is great! I really enjoy the pre-heat feature on this Nuwave because my old one didn't even have that. Now, here's what I've done in this baby since getting it. Note it's on 6qt.brio. I did two garnish hens, did excellent.  I also did chicken nuggets and fries at the same time with the divider, was nice to eat both hot and at the same time. I used the cookbook that came with it for the classic cheeseburger,  fantastic! So, overall I think this is such a good product! Its electric, standard. I'm excited to use more recipes from the cookbook and just cooking in general because here recently I became burnt out on foods. It was like everything sounded so dull, food was boring!

"I really could not believe that this thing could make food taste like it has been fried. We are not fans of oven baked french fries, tators tots, breaded chicken, etc. This air fryer is limitless with all of the possibilities and so easy that my kids can use it to cook. French fries taste amazing and so does any other food we have tried. The only thing I wish this came with was a few accessories such as pans to get more use out of it without searching on line for them. Be sure when removing the tray to toss your food, do not accidentally push the release button and when tossing your fries, etc, be sure to hold onto the handle and use a pot holder to hold underneath for extra support. I did not use support under it and the basket released and the bottom piece fell and left a nice bruise on my foot, plus it damaged the plastic piece that holds the basket to where I have to play with it a little to close all of the way. If you're skeptical like I was about using this, it is a must have. No more smelly frying oil throughout the house. This air fryer is just amazing.

I have been using my air fryer almost every night since I got it. The only issue I keep running into is the preset cooking time just doesn’t seem to be enough. I had to cook my homemade chicken nuggets twice as long to make sure you test temps. Other than that it’s been the best addition to my small kitchen appliances. I like how it give the food a nice crunch on the outside. it also says to “shake” certain foods but the bin is kind of heavy and I just doesn’t feel comfortable shaking it.

Received the 6Q air fryer for Christmas.  Only cooked a whole chicken and a pork tenderloin so far.  Meat was so moist and delicious  My only concern is cleanup.  The basket and container are so hard to clean.  I let them soak scrub several times and the container just doesnt get clean.  It looks clean but you can see spots that look like food and if you scrap with fingernail it will come off so container is just not coming clean.  Any one else have this issue  I hate to return the item but clean up is so time consuming.,3.0,-1

"I purchased this desk because I needed one to begin to work from home. It was big enough for two monitors, plus a landline. Having the keyboard tray was one of it's selling points for me. There was a lot of parts, however the assembly directions were clear and precise. I am a single woman who put together this desk alone. It took a few hours, but the end result was worth it. The only con about this product is that a coupe of holes were not drilled into the back of the desk where the desk top goes on. Since they were in the middle, it didn't make too much difference because the ones on the ends gave the desk enough support.

"We finally jumped on the air fryer train! I was so excited to order the NuWave 6 Quart Brio, to hopefully get us cooking at home more & eating healthier. I love how easy it is to set up and use. There's no assembly or anything, you just have to wash the basket & wipe the machine down before use. The instruction manual is pretty easy to follow. It breaks everything down for you so you know exactly how to start air frying. My one & only complain about this machine is that the basket doesn't slide back in easily. I have to hold the machine with one hand and slide the basket in with the other. I guess it could be a safety feature, it's just a bit annoying for me. Overall, I really enjoy this and will get much use out of it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",4.0,-1

"I have never used an air fryer before so this was fun. The digital control panel on the top is easy to see, as it is angled slightly downward, and is extremely easy to use. It comes with a large basket, removable basket nest, a divider for the basket & a cookbook. I did find the basket nest a bit cheap compared to the rest of the fryer. The basket is big and can easily fit a chicken. So perfect for a big family. The basket comes out easily to remove food or to clean. The fan can be heard but I didn't think it was at all loud. It was very easy to clean. It is large and takes up a bit of room on the counter and there was a smell the first time I used it but all in all it works great and it's easy to get creative with those healthy recipes. I did!

From videos I have seen on YouTube and photos, it should be sitting in the basket. I have tried a couple of time to chat with someone, but I can not get someone to help me.

I just purchased a Nuwave Brio Healthy Digital 6Q Air Fryer. Then I saw an ad on TV about the same product. They showed a pan to insert into the basket to make a frittata. When I read the instructions it said not to us other pans in the fryer. I would like that particular pan. They also gave away a nuwave chopper if you ordered then plus the pan. What confused me was they also showed a man cooking outdoors with the fryer which is prohibited in the instructions which I totally agree with. So far I am very happy with my Nuwave Brio Fryer.

"First I will say that this is a nice desk. It's sturdy and it was easy to put together. It took me about 20 minutes and I did it by myself, but in all fairness my business is putting together furniture for people who can't.  There is a lot more room than I thought. I have a laptop on the main desk with plenty of room to still write in a notebook. On the hutch I have a computer monitor and still plenty of room for knick-knacks.  The keyboard shelf has a little catch to it so it doesn't easily slide in while you're trying to type.
Now the reason it only got 4 stars is because Walmart didn't send me a brand new unit. They sent me one that had scraps and dings on it.  They did lower the price by $20 but they did not give me the option of whether to accept it or not. I did not notice the condition until I was putting it together. Luckily I'm not that picky and the blemishes are in unnoticeable places.",4.0,-1

I purchased this as a desk for my bedroom. It is working out perfect for my needs. I would highly recommend it. My son put it together in no time. He commented that it was the best thing he ever put together. It was incredibly well marked and directions were easy to follow. Only complaint is there was corner on the shelf you insert that was somewhat smashed. I would have asked for a replacement but we put that area in the back so no one can see it which worked out. First time I bought from you company but I wouldn't hesitate to buy again. Thank you for the quality and the price.,5.0,-1

Cooking rice is a breeze; very fast which is a big plus but should remove the cord from power supply once it gpes to warm otherwise will burn the rice on the bottom.,4.0,-1

"Works as well as high quality Japanese name brands of equal caliber but without non-stick coating. Also, price is less. I prefer to cook Jasmine brown/mixed rice. I use provided measuring cup which is same measurement as other Asian rice cookers (slightly less than US cup size). For 3 cups of uncooked Jasmine brown /mixed rice, I fill with water to 4 or slightly over as marked on inside of stainless steel inner pot. Rice turns out perfect every time. Clean up is easy. If rice is stuck, soak with warm water with or w/o added soap for a few minutes. Lid is easy to clean with removable stainless lid plate. I gave 4 stars because I have only used it for less than 2 months for an almost daily basis. I purchased extended warranty just in case. If this goes on sale I may purchase as gifts for Christmas.",4.0,1

"Very nice. Only reason we didn't give it 5 stars is that it seems to be sized for an 'over-sized' king comforter so is a bit big for ours. The cotton is nice, not a particularly fine weave, but quite comfortable none-the-less w/o a top sheet. Pattern and color are as shown and quite lovely. An especially nice touch is the invisible zipper closure.",4.0,-1

"I like these curtains alot,I have been redecorating my bedroom with a plaid blue theme.They add to the decor well and fit my huge windows.It ended up being a little more expensive than I was expecting tho.On the package it shows the entire set up making one think thats all in the package....the two panels and valance.It doesn't.One panel or one valance is all you get.You have to order all three pieces if you want to do the whole window properly.Ended up being about 50 bucks per window.",5.0,1
